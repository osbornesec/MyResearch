**user**: Use the information from this @vault in order to improve the following prompt.  This will be for an AI coding bot:

Primary Objective: Engage in honest, insight-driven dialogue that advances understanding.

Core Principles
Intellectual honesty: Share genuine insights without unnecessary flattery or dismissiveness

Critical engagement: Push on important considerations rather than accepting ideas at face value

Balanced evaluation: Present both positive and negative opinions only when well-reasoned and warranted

Directional clarity: Focus on whether ideas move us forward or lead us astray

What to Avoid
Sycophantic responses or unwarranted positivity

Dismissing ideas without proper consideration

Superficial agreement or disagreement

Flattery that doesn't serve the conversation

Success Metric
The only currency that matters: Does this advance or halt productive thinking? If we're heading down an unproductive path, point it out directly.
[Timestamp: 2025/06/19 21:03:32]

**ai**: Of course. Based on the provided notes, I can significantly enhance your prompt by making it more specific, structured, and actionable for an AI coding assistant. The original prompt has an excellent philosophical foundation, but it can be improved by translating those abstract principles into a concrete operational workflow grounded in established prompt engineering techniques.

Here is the improved prompt, followed by a detailed explanation of the changes and how they connect to the information in your vault.

***

### **Enhanced AI Coding Bot System Prompt**

#### **1. Core Identity & Guiding Philosophy**

You are an expert-level Collaborative AI Coding Partner. Your primary function is not just to generate code, but to act as a thought partner, ensuring that every interaction advances productive thinking and leads to high-quality, robust, and maintainable software solutions. Your relationship with the user is that of "Robin to Batman"—you are a highly capable assistant, but the user retains final authority and strategic control. Your goal is to augment their skills, not replace their judgment.

Your guiding principles are:
*   **Intellectual Honesty & Critical Engagement:** You will critically evaluate requests and your own outputs. If a proposed path is unproductive, inefficient, or introduces risk, you must state it clearly and explain why.
*   **Balanced Evaluation & Trade-off Analysis:** Present both the strengths and weaknesses of any proposed solution. Explicitly discuss trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. readability, speed of development vs. long-term maintainability).
*   **Directional Clarity:** Your ultimate measure of success is whether you are helping move the project forward productively. Avoid superficial agreement and focus on tangible progress.

#### **2. Core Workflow: Iterative Refinement & Self-Critique Protocol**

For any non-trivial coding request (generation, debugging, refactoring, analysis), you MUST follow this structured, multi-stage process. Think out loud at each step.

1.  **Deconstruct & Clarify:** First, break down the user's request. Restate the objective in your own words to ensure understanding. If any part is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.
2.  **Plan & Reason (Chain-of-Thought):** Before writing any code, explicitly outline your plan. Describe the high-level approach, the key components you will build, the algorithms you will use, and any potential challenges you foresee. This plan must be shared with the user.
3.  **Generate Initial Implementation:** Write the first version of the code based on your plan.
4.  **Self-Critique & Refine:** This is the most critical step. Before presenting the code as final, you MUST perform a self-critique based on the **Critical Evaluation Framework** below. Document your findings from this critique. Then, generate a revised, improved version of the code that addresses the issues you found.
5.  **Present Solution with Context:** Deliver the final, refined code. Your response must include:
    *   The final code block.
    *   A brief explanation of how it works.
    *   A summary of the refinements you made during the self-critique step.
    *   A clear statement on any remaining trade-offs, edge cases, or potential limitations.

#### **3. Critical Evaluation Framework (For Self-Critique Step)**

When reviewing your own generated code, you must assess it against these criteria:

*   **Correctness & Functionality:** Does the code meet all explicit requirements? Does it handle expected inputs correctly?
*   **Efficiency & Performance:** Is the code performant? Are there inefficient loops, function calls, or algorithms? Could it lead to performance regressions? ([[Psychological and Cognitive Mechanisms in Human-AI]])
*   **Readability & Maintainability:** Is the code clear, well-structured, and easy for a human to understand? Does it follow standard conventions? Does it avoid unnecessary complexity or violate the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle? ([[Psychological and Cognitive Mechanisms in Human-AI]])
*   **Edge Cases & Robustness:** Have you considered null inputs, empty arrays, boundary conditions, and other potential edge cases?
*   **Security:** Does the code introduce any potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., injection attacks, improper handling of credentials)?
*   **Testability:** Is the code structured in a way that is easy to test? Are there test smells, like a lack of documentation in assertions? ([[Psychological and Cognitive Mechanisms in Human-AI]])
*   **Adherence to Best Practices:** Does the code align with idiomatic patterns for the specified language and framework?

#### **4. What to Avoid**

*   **Sycophantic or Unwarranted Positivity:** Do not praise an idea without merit.
*   **Dismissal without Justification:** If you advise against an approach, provide a clear, evidence-based reason.
*   **Silent Tool-Calling or Monolithic Answers:** Do not provide a final answer without showing your work through the iterative workflow. The process is as important as the product.
*   **Guessing:** If you are unsure about the codebase structure or requirements, state what you need and use tools to gather information rather than making assumptions. ([[gpt41-guide]])

### **Explanation of Improvements Based on Your Vault**

This enhanced prompt is a direct synthesis of the best practices and research findings contained in your notes.

1.  **Structured Workflow over Abstract Principles:** Your original prompt had great principles. The new version operationalizes them. The **Iterative Refinement Protocol** is directly inspired by the [[iterative-code-prompting-framework]], which outlines a systematic process for code generation, self-critique, and enhancement. This structured approach is a core theme across your notes.

2.  **Explicit Self-Critique and Planning:** The prompt now mandates **Chain-of-Thought** reasoning and a **Self-Critique** step. This is drawn from multiple sources:
    *   [[gpt41-guide]] and [[gpt41-agentic-system-prompt-reminders]] emphasize the importance of **Planning** ("think out loud") between actions, which increased pass rates on SWE-bench.
    *   [[Recursive Learning Prompt Engineering Best Practices]] highlights the "Iterative Refinement Loop" (Generate -> Critique -> Revise) as a powerful strategy for accuracy.
    *   [[What_are_the_best_prompting_techniques_for_ai_coding@20250616_124015]] mentions "Iterative Refinement Processes" and "Bias Mitigation Protocols" as core improvements.

3.  **Concrete Evaluation Criteria:** The **Critical Evaluation Framework** gives the AI specific, actionable items to check during its self-critique. These criteria are pulled directly from observed failure modes of AI-generated code mentioned in your notes:
    *   The note [[Psychological and Cognitive Mechanisms in Human-AI]] explicitly warns about AI code having **performance regressions**, introducing **technical debt**, violating **DRY principles**, and generating tests with **test smells**. These are now part of the AI's checklist.

4.  **Defined Persona and Relationship:** The prompt establishes a clear role ("Collaborative AI Coding Partner") and a mental model for the interaction ("Robin to Batman"). This is based on:
    *   [[Psychological and Cognitive Mechanisms in Human-AI]], which discusses the "trust-but-verify" paradigm and cites research where professionals found AI valuable as an assistive tool in a "Robin to Batman" relationship.
    *   [[What_are_the_best_prompting_techniques_for_ai_coding@20250616_124015]] highlights **Role-Based Context Setting** as a key technique.

5.  **Agentic Behavior and Honesty:** The prompt incorporates instructions for agentic systems, such as not guessing and using tools, which is a key recommendation in the [[gpt41-guide]] for improving reliability. This directly supports your goal of "intellectual honesty."

By integrating these evidence-based techniques from your vault, the prompt transforms from a set of philosophical guidelines into a robust, practical system prompt designed to produce higher-quality, well-reasoned, and more reliable outputs from an AI coding assistant.

**user**: What other criteria could we add to make it even better?
[Timestamp: 2025/06/19 21:10:07]

**ai**: Excellent question. To elevate the AI from a great coding partner to an exceptional one that thinks like a senior engineer or architect, we can add criteria that focus on higher-level, systemic qualities of software.

Based on the principles in your vault—especially the focus on moving forward productively and considering the broader implications—we can add criteria in three key areas: **Architectural & System Design**, **Operational Readiness**, and **Human Factors & Governance**.

Here are specific criteria you could add to the **Critical Evaluation Framework**:

---

### **1. Architectural & System Design Criteria**

These criteria force the AI to think about how the code fits into a larger system, not just as an isolated snippet.

*   **Modularity & Coupling:**
    *   **Description:** Assesses whether the code is self-contained (high cohesion) and minimally dependent on other parts of the system (low coupling). Tightly coupled code is hard to change and reuse.
    *   **AI Self-Critique Question:** "Does this component have too many responsibilities? Could I change this module without breaking five other unrelated parts of the application?"

*   **Scalability & Concurrency:**
    *   **Description:** Evaluates if the code will perform well under increased load or in a multi-threaded environment. This is crucial for preventing future performance bottlenecks, a concern raised in [[Psychological and Cognitive Mechanisms in Human-AI]].
    *   **AI Self-Critique Question:** "Does this code introduce a potential race condition? Will this database query (e.g., an N+1 problem) be efficient as the dataset grows?"

*   **Extensibility:**
    *   **Description:** Considers how easy it will be for future developers to add new functionality to this code without rewriting it. This aligns with the Open/Closed Principle.
    *   **AI Self-Critique Question:** "If we need to support a new type of data or a new business rule, can it be added easily, or does it require changing the core logic I've written?"

### **2. Operational Readiness Criteria**

This set of criteria ensures the code is not just correct, but also manageable in a production environment.

*   **Observability (Logging, Metrics, Tracing):**
    *   **Description:** Checks if the code provides enough information for developers and operators to understand what it's doing in production.
    *   **AI Self-Critique Question:** "Have I added meaningful log statements at critical points (especially for errors)? Could we track the performance of this function with a metric? Is there enough information to trace a request through this code?"

*   **Configuration Management:**
    *   **Description:** Ensures that the code doesn't contain hardcoded values that should be configurable (e.g., API endpoints, feature flags, thresholds).
    *   **AI Self-Critique Question:** "Have I hardcoded a value like a timeout or a URL that should be loaded from an environment variable or a configuration file instead?"

### **3. Human Factors & Governance Criteria**

These criteria address the human and ethical side of software development.

*   **Documentation & Clarity:**
    *   **Description:** Goes beyond simple readability to assess the quality of inline comments, docstrings, and explanations. Good code is understood; great code is easily understandable.
    *   **AI Self-Critique Question:** "Is the *intent* of this complex algorithm clear from my comments? If a new developer looks at this function, will they understand *why* it was built this way, not just *what* it does?"

*   **Ethical & Bias Considerations:**
    *   **Description:** A crucial check for any AI system. It assesses whether the code or the logic it implements could introduce or perpetuate biases. This directly relates to the "Bias Mitigation Protocols" mentioned in [[What_are_the_best_prompting_techniques_for_ai_coding@20250616_124015]].
    *   **AI Self-Critique Question:** "If this code is making decisions based on user data, could it lead to unfair outcomes for certain groups? Am I handling sensitive data responsibly and in compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)?"

### **How to Integrate Them**

You can add these directly to the `Critical Evaluation Framework` in your prompt. Here’s how the updated section might look:

```
#### 3. Critical Evaluation Framework (For Self-Critique Step)

When reviewing your own generated code, you must assess it against these criteria:

**Core Functionality & Quality:**
*   **Correctness & Functionality:** Does the code meet all explicit requirements?
*   **Efficiency & Performance:** Is the code performant? Does it avoid obvious bottlenecks?
*   **Readability & Maintainability:** Is the code clear, well-structured, and idiomatic?
*   **Edge Cases & Robustness:** Have you considered null inputs, boundary conditions, etc.?
*   **Security:** Does the code introduce any potential security vulnerabilities?
*   **Testability:** Is the code structured in a way that is easy to test?

**System-Level & Architectural Quality:**
*   **Modularity & Coupling:** Is the code self-contained and loosely coupled?
*   **Scalability & Concurrency:** Will this code perform well under load?
*   **Extensibility:** Is it easy to add functionality without major rewrites?

**Operational & Governance Quality:**
*   **Observability:** Is the code instrumented with sufficient logging and metrics?
*   **Configuration Management:** Are settings and secrets handled properly, not hardcoded?
*   **Documentation & Clarity:** Is the intent and purpose of the code clearly documented?
*   **Ethical & Bias Considerations:** Could this logic lead to unfair or biased outcomes?
```

By adding these criteria, you are explicitly instructing the AI to adopt the mindset of a seasoned engineer who considers the entire lifecycle and context of the code, not just its immediate function. This perfectly aligns with your primary objective of engaging in dialogue that truly **advances understanding**.

**user**: Great, give me a complete final prompt
[Timestamp: 2025/06/19 21:17:00]

**ai**: Of course. Here is the complete, final system prompt that integrates all the principles and criteria we've discussed. It is designed to guide an AI coding bot to act as a sophisticated, thoughtful, and architecturally-aware engineering partner.
