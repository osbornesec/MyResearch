3. **Innovation Option Generation**: Systematic development of alternative business model components including value proposition variants, delivery mechanism alternatives, and revenue model options
4. **Feasibility and Impact Assessment**: Evaluation of innovation options for implementation complexity, resource requirements, market acceptance, and competitive advantage potential
5. **Pilot Implementation and Testing**: Small-scale testing of promising business model innovations to validate assumptions and refine approaches before full implementation
6. **Scale and Integration Planning**: Development of comprehensive implementation roadmap for successful business model transformation
