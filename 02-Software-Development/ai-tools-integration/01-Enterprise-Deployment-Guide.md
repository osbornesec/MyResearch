## GitHub Copilot Enterprise Deployment

### Phase 1: Pilot Implementation (Weeks 1-4)

#### Step 1: Organization Setup
```bash
# GitHub Enterprise Admin Console
1. Navigate to Enterprise Settings
2. Enable Copilot for Enterprise
3. Configure organization policies:
   - Allow Copilot suggestions matching public code: [Blocked/Allowed]
   - Allow Copilot to access organization data: [Enabled]
   - Enable Copilot Chat: [Enabled]
```

#### Step 2: Knowledge Base Configuration
```yaml
# .github/copilot-instructions.md
project_context: |
  This enterprise application follows microservices architecture
  with specific coding standards and security requirements.

coding_standards:
  - Use TypeScript for all new frontend code
  - Follow OWASP security guidelines
  - Implement comprehensive error handling
  - Include unit tests for all business logic

prohibited_patterns:
  - Direct database queries in controllers
  - Hardcoded secrets or configuration
  - Synchronous operations for I/O
```

#### Step 3: Pilot Team Selection
**Criteria for Pilot Teams:**
- 5-10 experienced developers
- Mix of frontend/backend/full-stack roles
- Working on non-critical projects initially
- Open to providing feedback and metrics

#### Step 4: Baseline Measurement
```javascript
// Productivity tracking script
const productivityMetrics = {
  codeWritingTime: [], // Track before/after
  debuggingTime: [],   // Monitor reduction
