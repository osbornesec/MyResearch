# App Development Workflow Guide

This guide explains how to use our three-phase collaborative app development workflow. This systematic approach takes you from initial concept to implementation-ready tasks with the help of AI assistance.

## Overview: A Three-Phase Collaborative Process

1. **Phase 1: App Vision Brainstorming** - Collaboratively explore your app concept
2. **Phase 2: Feature Breakdown** - Deep-dive into individual features
3. **Phase 3: Implementation Planning** - Create technically specific, actionable tasks

## How to Use This Workflow

### Getting Started

1. Create a new Claude project for each phase
2. Copy the appropriate prompt into your conversation
3. Follow the collaborative process through all three phases
4. Save the documents created at each phase for reference in subsequent phases

### Workflow Benefits

- **Comprehensive Planning:** Explore all aspects of your app systematically
- **Structured Documentation:** Generate clear plans you can reference throughout development
- **Progressive Refinement:** Start broad and systematically narrow down to specific tasks
- **Collaborative Ideation:** Get suggestions and alternatives you might not have considered
- **Technical Alignment:** Ensure all parts of your app work together cohesively

## Recommended Document Organization

Keep your project documentation organized with a consistent structure:

```
app-project/
  ├── 1-vision/
  │   └── masterplan.md
  ├── 2-features/
  │   ├── feature-F1-[name].md
  │   ├── feature-F2-[name].md
  │   └── ...
  └── 3-implementation/
      ├── implementation-F1-[name].md
      ├── implementation-F2-[name].md
      └── ...
```

## Using Each Phase Effectively

### Phase 1: App Vision Brainstorming

**Purpose:** Define your app's overall concept, target users, core features, and technical approach.

**Process:**
1. Describe your initial app idea
2. Engage in a creative back-and-forth conversation
3. Explore various possibilities and approaches
4. Review and refine the generated masterplan.md

**Key Outcomes:**
- A comprehensive masterplan document with labeled features (F1, F2, etc.)
- Clear technical stack recommendations
- Prioritized development phases

### Phase 2: Feature Breakdown

**Purpose:** Transform high-level features into detailed specifications.

**Process:**
1. Share your masterplan.md from Phase 1
2. Select a feature to explore (start with highest priority ones)
3. Collaboratively discuss user workflows, technical requirements, and design considerations
4. Review and refine the generated feature breakdown document
5. Repeat for each key feature

**Key Outcomes:**
- Detailed feature specification documents
- Clear understanding of user workflows
- Technical requirements and design considerations
- Dependencies between features

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning

**Purpose:** Create actionable, technically specific implementation tasks.

**Process:**
1. Share your masterplan.md and relevant feature breakdown documents
2. Discuss implementation approach, environment, and preferences
3. Collaboratively plan the implementation sequence and structure
4. Review and refine the generated implementation plan
5. Repeat for each feature you're ready to implement

**Key Outcomes:**
- Comprehensive implementation context
- Specific, actionable technical tasks
- Clear development roadmap

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Open to Suggestions:** The most valuable insights often come from exploring ideas you hadn't considered
2. **Share Constraints Early:** Let the AI know about any technical limitations or preferences
3. **Prioritize Features Wisely:** Start with foundational features before dependent ones
4. **Iterate When Needed:** Don't hesitate to revisit earlier phases if new insights emerge
5. **Maintain Document Consistency:** Use consistent naming and organization
6. **Share Complete Context:** Always provide previous documents when starting a new phase

Remember, this workflow is meant to be collaborative and adaptable. Each phase helps you think more deeply about your application, but the ultimate decisions are always yours.

Happy building!
