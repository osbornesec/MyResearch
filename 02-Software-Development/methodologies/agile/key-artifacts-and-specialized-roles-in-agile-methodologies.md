## Conclusion

Agile SDLC artifacts are shaped by the collaboration of specialized roles:

- **Software Architects** ensure system coherence and scalability.
- **Frontend/Backend Engineers** translate requirements into functional code.
- **DevOps Engineers** streamline delivery pipelines.
- **QA Engineers** safeguard quality through rigorous testing.
- **Technical Writers** bridge the gap between technical and end-user documentation.

By aligning artifacts with role-specific responsibilities, teams maintain agility while delivering robust, user-centric solutions. Tools like Jira (for backlog management) and Git (for version control) further enhance transparency, ensuring artifacts evolve alongside the product [^2][^5][^9].
