# Major Document Categories in BDUF-Aligned Waterfall SDLC

## 1. Requirements Documentation

**Purpose**: Formally captures stakeholder needs, functional specifications, and system constraints to establish a contractual baseline for development[^2][^6][^8].
**SDLC Phases**:

- **Initiated** during initial project planning
- **Developed** through requirements engineering phase
- **Finalized** before design phase begins
Key artifacts: Software Requirements Specification (SRS), use case diagrams, traceability matrices[^8][^12].


## 2. Architectural \& Design Documentation

**Purpose**: Provides technical blueprints for system implementation through layered specifications of components, interfaces, and data flows[^3][^9][^12].
**SDLC Phases**:

- **Initiated** during system design phase
- **Developed** through logical/physical design stages
- **Finalized** before implementation starts
Key artifacts: System architecture documents, UML diagrams, database schemas, interface control documents[^9][^17].


## 3. Project Management Artifacts

**Purpose**: Defines work breakdown structures, resource allocation, and risk mitigation strategies to ensure predictable execution[^4][^7][^18].
**SDLC Phases**:

- **Initiated** during project planning
- **Developed** throughout all phases
- **Finalized** as phase-gate approvals occur
Key artifacts: Project charter, Gantt charts, risk registers, change control plans[^4][^16][^18].


## 4. Verification \& Validation Documentation

**Purpose**: Establishes quality assurance protocols and acceptance criteria through systematic test planning[^10][^17][^19].
**SDLC Phases**:

- **Initiated** during requirements phase
- **Developed** in design/implementation phases
- **Finalized** during testing phase
Key artifacts: Test plans, test cases, defect logs, validation reports[^10][^17].


## 5. Implementation Specifications

**Purpose**: Provides developer-facing technical instructions for translating designs into executable code[^6][^9][^12].
**SDLC Phases**:

- **Initiated** during detailed design
- **Developed** during implementation
- **Finalized** before system testing
Key artifacts: Pseudocode, API specifications, data dictionary, unit test scripts[^6][^9].


## 6. Deployment \& Operational Documentation

**Purpose**: Enables system transition to production and long-term maintainability[^6][^11][^17].
**SDLC Phases**:

- **Initiated** during design phase
- **Developed** during implementation
- **Finalized** during deployment
Key artifacts: Installation guides, runbooks, maintenance procedures, user manuals[^6][^11].


## 7. Compliance \& Standards Documentation

**Purpose**: Ensures adherence to regulatory requirements and institutionalized best practices[^8][^9][^11].
**SDLC Phases**:

- **Initiated** during project planning
- **Developed** throughout all phases
- **Finalized** during final acceptance
Key artifacts: IEEE 830-compliant SRS, audit trails, safety cases, accessibility reports[^8][^9][^11].

**Critical Review \& Refinement**
Initial draft included potential overlap between implementation specs and design docs. Final version distinguishes them by:

1. **Design Documentation** (architectural decisions) vs **Implementation Specifications** (coding directives)
2. Explicitly separating **Compliance** as cross-cutting concern
3. Aligning phase transitions with Waterfall's phase-gate model[^12][^17]
4. Incorporating IEEE standards for requirements (830) and design (1016) as foundational references[^8][^9]

This structure ensures each document category supports BDUF's core objectives of risk reduction through meticulous pre-implementation planning[^7][^16][^19].
