# Introduction to Prompt Engineering

## Overview

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective instructions for AI language models to achieve desired outputs. This foundational tutorial covers the essential concepts and techniques for creating robust prompts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will:
- Understand the fundamentals of prompt engineering
- Learn basic prompt structure and components
- Practice writing clear and effective prompts
- Recognize common prompt engineering pitfalls

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering involves:
- **Instruction Design**: Crafting clear, specific instructions
- **Context Management**: Providing relevant background information
- **Output Formatting**: Specifying desired response structure
- **Iterative Refinement**: Testing and improving prompts

## Basic Prompt Structure

### Essential Components

1. **Task Definition**: Clearly state what you want the AI to do
2. **Context**: Provide necessary background information
3. **Format Specification**: Define how you want the output structured
4. **Examples** (optional): Show desired input/output patterns

### Example Basic Prompt

```
Task: Summarize the key points from the following text
Context: This is a technical article about cloud computing
Format: Provide 3-5 bullet points
Text: [content here]
```

## Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Vague prompts lead to inconsistent results
- **Use Clear Language**: Avoid ambiguous terms
- **Provide Examples**: Show the AI what good output looks like
- **Test and Iterate**: Refine prompts based on results
