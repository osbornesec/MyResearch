## Lessons Learned

### Effective Extraction Patterns
1. **Architectural Patterns**: Abstract coordination and communication mechanisms extract well
2. **Methodological Frameworks**: Structured approaches (like Kotter's 8 steps) make excellent atomics
3. **Measurement Models**: Multi-dimensional frameworks benefit from atomic extraction
4. **Technical Systems**: Complex technical systems (like documentation ecosystems) extract effectively

### Optimal Extraction Criteria Application
- **High-Priority**: Foundational concepts used across multiple contexts (5/5 extractions)
- **Cross-Domain Utility**: All extracted concepts have application beyond software development
- **Reusability**: Each atomic concept can be referenced without accessing source material

## Future Extraction Opportunities

### Immediate (Next 2 Weeks)
- **Security Compliance Framework**: Extract 2-3 security and compliance patterns
- **Enterprise Deployment Guide**: Extract infrastructure and deployment concepts
- **Code Review Guide**: Extract review patterns and quality frameworks

### Medium-Term (Next Month)
