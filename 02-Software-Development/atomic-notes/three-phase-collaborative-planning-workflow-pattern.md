# Three-Phase Collaborative Planning Workflow Pattern

## Core Concept

*A systematic AI-enhanced planning methodology progressing through Vision Brainstorming (concept exploration), Feature Breakdown (detailed specification), and Implementation Planning (actionable task creation) to transform ideas into technically specific development roadmaps.*

## Content

**What is the core idea?**
Phase 1 creates a comprehensive masterplan through collaborative exploration of app concepts, target users, and technical approaches. Phase 2 transforms high-level features into detailed specifications with user workflows and technical requirements. Phase 3 generates granular, technically precise implementation tasks with specific file paths, component details, and validation criteria.

**Why is it important?**
This workflow provides:
- Progressive refinement from concept to actionable tasks
- Collaborative ideation capturing insights beyond individual thinking
- Structured documentation enabling clear handoffs between phases
- Technical alignment ensuring architectural coherence
- Risk reduction through systematic planning before implementation
- Scalable planning suitable for individual developers or teams

**How does it connect to other concepts?**
This pattern adapts BDUF planning principles for modern AI-enhanced development, supports agile iteration within structured phases, and enables hybrid development approaches balancing planning with flexibility.
