# CheckPoint Maestro Cluster Control Protocol UDP 8116

## Core Concept
UDP port 8116 serves as the transport for CheckPoint's proprietary Cluster Control Protocol (CCP), providing the communication backbone for Maestro clusters. CCP implements state synchronization (Delta Sync), health monitoring, and failover coordination between Security Group Members, operating at kernel level to ensure uninterrupted cluster communication even during policy enforcement failures.

## Protocol Functions
- **State Synchronization (Delta Sync)**: Transfers connection state differentials between SGMs
- **Health Monitoring**: Member status reporting and cluster membership verification with 300ms default heartbeat
- **Failover Coordination**: State-change commands during member failures
- **Opcode Differentiation**: UDP payload contains opcodes distinguishing sync traffic from health checks

## Operational Characteristics
- **Interface binding**: Operates on all interfaces except those listed in discntd.if file
- **Communication method**: Uses UDP broadcast for local cluster communication
- **Traffic composition**: Constitutes 90% of cluster synchronization traffic
- **Policy exemption**: Not governed by security policies to ensure continuous operation

## Network Partition Handling
- **Dual Orchestrator resilience**: Active-active configuration ensures continuous operation through failures
- **Link redundancy**: DAC connections to both Orchestrators prevent single-point failures
- **Synchronization segregation**: Dedicated VLAN isolates state sync traffic (VLAN 800 + SGM number)
- **Partition tolerance**: Orchestrator arbitration isolates partitioned members and redistributes traffic

## Performance Specifications
- **Heartbeat interval**: 300ms default with configurable thresholds
- **Priority handling**: Synchronization packets take precedence over health checks during high-load
- **Latency requirements**: <2ms RTT for synchronization VLAN optimal performance
- **Failure detection**: Rapid identification of member status changes for automated recovery

## Source Quality
- **Primary Sources**: CheckPoint R81.20 Maestro Administration Guide, Cluster Control Protocol Documentation
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10 (Official technical documentation)
- **Validation Method**: Verified through multiple CheckPoint technical guides and protocol specifications

## Connection Potential
- Links to HyperSync state synchronization mechanisms
- Connects to dual-orchestrator redundancy architecture
- Related to VLAN-based traffic segregation strategies
- Integrates with network partition recovery protocols
