# AI-Assisted Development Workflow Symbiosis Patterns

## Core Concept

AI-assisted development workflows create symbiotic relationships between humans and AI systems through defined patterns: requirement articulation by humans, AI code generation, human review and refinement, iterative collaboration, and integration testing, resulting in 30-50% faster feature delivery while maintaining quality standards.

## Research Context

Understanding these symbiosis patterns is crucial for implementing effective AI-assisted development practices, as they represent the operational framework that enables the cultural transformation from traditional coding to vibe coding methodologies.
