# Zero Trust AI Security Architecture Principles

## Core Concept

Zero Trust AI security architecture operates on the principle of "assume no implicit trust in AI-generated code," implementing data minimization (limiting AI access to necessary data only), continuous monitoring with real-time security posture assessment, audit transparency for complete AI interaction traceability, and privacy by design with built-in protection mechanisms.

## Research Context

This approach is essential for enterprise AI deployment as it addresses the unique security challenges of AI systems that process sensitive code and data while maintaining traditional zero trust networking principles adapted for AI-specific risks.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Zero Trust Architecture for AI Coding Assistants - Security Framework Document
- **Credibility Score**: 8
- **Validation Method**: Aligned with NIST Zero Trust Architecture guidelines and enterprise security best practices

## Connection Potential

Connects to identity verification systems, device trust frameworks, network segmentation strategies, behavioral biometrics, and endpoint compliance requirements.

## Implementation Notes

Requires multi-factor authentication with behavioral biometrics, device compliance with endpoint protection and encryption, network micro-segmentation for AI tools, SSL inspection of AI traffic, and API security with fine-grained RBAC permissions.

## Evolution Notes
