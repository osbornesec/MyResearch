# Agent Abstraction Layer Pattern

## Core Concept

*A software design pattern that provides a unified interface for heterogeneous AI agents, enabling consistent coordination and communication across different MCP implementations while maintaining agent-specific capabilities*

## Content

The Agent Abstraction Layer Pattern addresses the challenge of coordinating diverse AI agents in a swarm intelligence system. This pattern defines a common interface that all agents must implement while preserving their unique capabilities and specializations.

### Key Components

**Abstract Base Class**: Defines the mandatory interface that all agents must implement:
- `execute(task: AgentTask): Promise<AgentResult>` - Core task execution
- `getStatus(): Promise<AgentStatus>` - Health and availability reporting  
- `handleMessage(message: AgentMessage): Promise<void>` - Inter-agent communication
- `getCapabilities(): Promise<AgentCapability[]>` - Capability discovery

**Specialized Implementations**: Each agent type extends the base class with domain-specific functionality:
- SequentialThinkingAgent for structured reasoning
- PerplexityAgent for research and fact-checking
- SupabaseAgent for database operations
- Custom domain agents for specific use cases

**Common Coordination Methods**: Shared infrastructure for swarm behavior:
- Status reporting to central coordinator
- Message routing between agents
- Capability registration and discovery
- Error handling and recovery

### Benefits

- **Interoperability**: Enables seamless integration of agents from different providers
- **Scalability**: New agent types can be added without modifying existing coordination logic
- **Maintainability**: Changes to coordination logic affect all agents consistently
- **Testability**: Standardized interface enables comprehensive testing strategies

### Implementation Considerations

- Agents maintain their specialized capabilities while conforming to the common interface
- The abstraction layer handles protocol translation between different MCP implementations
- Capability discovery enables dynamic task routing based on agent strengths
- Status reporting provides real-time visibility into swarm health
