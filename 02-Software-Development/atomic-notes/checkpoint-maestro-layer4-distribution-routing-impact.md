# CheckPoint Maestro Layer 4 Distribution Routing Protocol Impact

## Core Concept
Layer 4 distribution (enabled by default in Maestro) must be disabled for dynamic routing protocol stability. L4 hashing causes routing protocol packet misdirection to non-owning SGMs, triggering session resets and BGP/OSPF instability. The `set distribution l4-mode off` command is mandatory for environments using dynamic routing protocols.

## Stability Requirements
- **BGP peer oscillation**: L4 distribution misroutes BGP control packets causing session instability
- **OSPF adjacency issues**: Port-based hashing conflicts with OSPF hello packet processing
- **Mandatory disable command**: `asg> set distribution l4-mode off` required for protocol stability
- **Control packet sensitivity**: Routing protocols require consistent packet delivery to specific SGMs

## Distribution Mode Recommendations
- **Auto-Topology preferred**: Provides optimal routing without L4 conflicts
- **Network Mode**: Suitable for NAT-heavy deployments with routing protocols
- **Manual modes**: Cause 15-30% VSX performance degradation
- **General Mode**: Acceptable for static routing but problematic with dynamic protocols

## Performance Trade-offs
- **Routing stability**: Disabling L4 eliminates protocol packet misdirection
- **Load balancing impact**: Reduced entropy for non-routing traffic distribution
- **Elephant flow risk**: Potential for large flows to concentrate on single SGMs
- **NAT processing**: May increase correction rates in NAT environments

## Configuration Validation
- **Test procedure**: `ping -f -s 1472` during maintenance windows
- **Route verification**: Use `asg_arp` and `g_all asg stat` for validation
- **BGP session monitoring**: Check for control packet delivery consistency
- **OSPF neighbor status**: Verify stable adjacency formation across Security Group
