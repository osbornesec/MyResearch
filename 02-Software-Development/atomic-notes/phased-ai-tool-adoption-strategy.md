# Phased AI Tool Adoption Strategy

## Core Concept

*Systematic three-phase approach to enterprise AI tool deployment: Pilot implementation (weeks 1-6), Department rollout (weeks 7-18), and Enterprise scaling (weeks 19-30), with specific success criteria and risk mitigation at each stage.*

## Content

**What is the core idea?**
Successful enterprise AI adoption follows a structured progression: start with 5-10 experienced developers on non-critical projects, expand to department-wide deployment with advanced training, then scale to organization-wide implementation. Each phase has specific success criteria (90% pilot adoption, 85% department adoption, 80% enterprise adoption) and built-in risk management.

**Why is it important?**
Enables:
- Risk mitigation through gradual exposure
- Learning incorporation at each expansion stage
- Measurable progress with clear success criteria
- Resource optimization and cost management
- Cultural change management and resistance reduction

**How does it connect to other concepts?**
Implements enterprise change management principles, builds on technology adoption lifecycle patterns, and integrates with performance measurement frameworks.
