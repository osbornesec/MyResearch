# Stripe Webhook Security Pattern

## Core Concept

*Secure Stripe payment integration with proper webhook signature verification, idempotency key usage, comprehensive error handling for payment failures, and complete subscription lifecycle management with billing reconciliation.*

## Content

**What is the core idea?**
Stripe webhook security requires signature verification for all incoming webhooks, idempotency key implementation to prevent duplicate processing, comprehensive testing using Stripe's test environment, proper subscription lifecycle handling including upgrades and cancellations, and billing reconciliation for payment data consistency.

**Why is it important?**
Provides:
- Protection against webhook spoofing and replay attacks
- Reliable payment processing without duplicate charges
- Complete subscription management capabilities
- PCI compliance and secure customer data handling
- Accurate billing reconciliation and financial reporting

**How does it connect to other concepts?**
Implements payment security best practices, integrates with subscription management patterns, and supports financial data compliance requirements.
