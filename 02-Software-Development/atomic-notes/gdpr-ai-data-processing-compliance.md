# GDPR AI Data Processing Compliance

## Core Concept
Comprehensive framework for GDPR compliance in AI coding assistant deployments, covering legal basis establishment, data subject rights implementation, and privacy impact assessments.

## Why This Matters
AI coding assistants process developer data and potentially customer data within code, requiring explicit GDPR compliance measures including consent management and data subject rights.

## Implementation Guidance
- Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for AI deployments
- Establish legitimate interest as legal basis for productivity improvements
- Implement data subject rights: access, rectification, erasure, portability
- Create opt-out mechanisms for AI tool usage
- Deploy automated detection and masking for personal data in code
