# Node.js Async Patterns Optimization

## Core Concept

*Strategic implementation of Node.js 18+ asynchronous patterns using async/await over callbacks, proper event loop management, worker threads for CPU-intensive tasks, and performance monitoring to prevent blocking operations.*

## Content

**What is the core idea?**
Modern Node.js development leverages async/await patterns consistently, avoids event loop blocking through appropriate use of worker threads for CPU-intensive operations, implements proper error handling for rejected promises, and includes performance monitoring for response times, memory usage, and error rates.

**Why is it important?**
Provides:
- Optimal application performance and responsiveness
- Proper resource utilization and memory management
- Scalable architecture for high-concurrency applications
- Reliable error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Clear performance monitoring and optimization guidance

**How does it connect to other concepts?**
Implements modern JavaScript runtime optimization, supports scalable backend architecture patterns, and enables high-performance API development.
