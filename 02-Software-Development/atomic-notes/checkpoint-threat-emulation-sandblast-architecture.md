# CheckPoint Threat Emulation SandBlast Architecture

## Core Concept
Threat Emulation (SandBlast) combines offline sandboxing with real-time content reconstruction to neutralize zero-day threats. The system intercepts files, compares cryptographic hashes against ThreatCloud's database, and routes unrecognized files to instrumented virtual environments while parallel Threat Extraction provides immediate sanitized file delivery.

## Processing Pipeline
- **Hash comparison**: Files checked against ThreatCloud's global malware database
- **Sandbox execution**: Unknown files run in instrumented Windows OS/Office/browser environments
- **Behavioral monitoring**: 57 indicators including registry modification, process injection, network beaconing
- **Evasion detection**: CPU-level instrumentation detects sandbox-aware malware techniques

## Parallel Processing Architecture
- **Threat Emulation**: Offline analysis in cloud or on-premises sandboxes
- **Threat Extraction (CDR)**: Immediate content disarm and reconstruction for safe file delivery
- **Delivery options**: Clean file within 2 seconds via content extraction or PDF conversion
- **Analysis locations**: ThreatCloud (cloud-based) or on-premises Threat Emulation appliances

## Deployment Models
- **Inline MTA integration**: Email attachment processing
- **ICAP server deployment**: Web download inspection
- **SPAN port monitoring**: Passive traffic inspection
- **HTTPS inspection**: SSL/TLS traffic analysis with certificate management

## Performance Specifications
- **Detection rate**: 99.6% zero-day threat identification
- **Processing latency**: 3-8 seconds for 50MB files
- **Analysis capacity**: 40+ supported file types
- **Cloud pre-caching**: R82 enhancement reduces latency through predictive analysis

## Source Quality
- **Primary Sources**: CheckPoint Threat Prevention Administration Guide, SandBlast Technical Specifications
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10 (Official technical documentation)
- **Validation Method**: Verified through CheckPoint threat prevention guides and deployment documentation

## Connection Potential
- Links to ThreatCloud global intelligence database
- Connects to Software Blade coordination architecture
- Related to Content Disarm & Reconstruction (CDR) technology
- Integrates with Anti-Bot threat correlation mechanisms
