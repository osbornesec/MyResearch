# CheckPoint Maestro SMO Master Election Mechanism

## Core Concept
Maestro implements deterministic SMO (Single Management Object) Master election based on Security Group Member status and numeric identifier. Only SGMs in Active state participate in election, with the appliance having the lowest numeric ID automatically assuming SMO Master role. This lightweight election protocol prioritizes operational simplicity over complex consensus algorithms.

## Election Process
1. **Active status prerequisite**: Only Security Group Members in Active state participate in election
2. **Lowest ID selection**: Among active members, appliance with lowest numeric ID becomes SMO Master
3. **Automatic failover**: If current SMO Master fails, election immediately repeats with remaining active members
4. **Continuous operation**: Election mechanism operates without administrator intervention

## Task Distribution Model
- **SMO Master responsibilities**: Policy installation, logging, configuration synchronization
- **Distributed tasks**: LACP management (local per member), CH Monitor (distributed), UIPC processing (distributed)
- **Centralized functions**: DR Manager runs exclusively on SMO Master
- **Failure resilience**: Non-master member failures don't affect SMO operations

## Operational Characteristics
- **Election speed**: Immediate upon master failure detection
- **Management continuity**: Newly elected master assumes all functions without service interruption
- **Visibility command**: `asg stat -i tasks` shows current SMO Master assignment
- **No consensus overhead**: Controller-worker model eliminates distributed agreement requirements

## Orchestrator Authority
- **Centralized control**: Orchestrator maintains ultimate authority over group membership and role assignment
- **Traffic distribution**: Orchestrator makes all path decisions without member consensus
- **State arbitration**: During network partitions, Orchestrator isolates partitioned members
- **Membership management**: Only Orchestrator can add/remove SGMs from Security Groups

## Source Quality
- **Primary Sources**: CheckPoint R81.20 Quantum Maestro Administration Guide
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10 (Official technical documentation)
- **Validation Method**: Verified through official CheckPoint administration guides and CLI documentation

## Connection Potential
- Links to HyperSync state synchronization technology
- Connects to Orchestrator traffic distribution mechanisms
- Related to Security Group membership management
- Integrates with failover and redundancy protocols
