# Intelligent Developer Onboarding System

## Core Concept
AI-powered onboarding system that assesses developer skills, creates personalized learning paths, matches mentors, configures AI tools based on experience level, and tracks progress with adaptive plan adjustment.

## Why This Matters
Traditional onboarding is one-size-fits-all and inefficient, while AI-powered personalization accelerates developer productivity and reduces time-to-contribution for new team members.

## Implementation Guidance
- Use AI to assess skills from resume, GitHub profile, and coding samples
- Generate personalized learning paths based on role requirements and team context
- Configure AI tools based on experience: high assistance for beginners, advanced patterns for experienced
- Match with appropriate mentors using skill complementarity analysis
- Track progress across git activity, AI tool usage, and peer feedback
- Adapt plans based on progress analysis and identified challenges
