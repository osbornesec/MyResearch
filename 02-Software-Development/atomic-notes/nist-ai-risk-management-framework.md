# NIST AI Risk Management Framework

## Core Concept
Four-step framework (Govern, Map, Measure, Manage) for systematic AI risk assessment and mitigation across reliability, safety, fairness, explainability, privacy, and security categories.

## Why This Matters
Provides comprehensive methodology for identifying, measuring, and mitigating AI risks in enterprise environments with standardized assessment categories and governance structures.

## Implementation Guidance
- Establish AI governance structure with risk assessment committee
- Map AI risks across six categories: reliability, safety, fairness, explainability, privacy, security
- Implement measurement systems for each risk category
- Develop risk mitigation strategies based on assessment results
- Create compliance monitoring and reporting mechanisms
