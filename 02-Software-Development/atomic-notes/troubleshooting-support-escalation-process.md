# Troubleshooting Support Escalation Process

## Core Concept

A structured four-tier support escalation framework for AI development tools that ensures rapid issue resolution through progressive expertise levels, from basic configuration problems to complex custom development requirements.

## Escalation Tier Architecture

### Level 1: Internal IT Support
- **Scope**: Basic configuration issues, user access problems, license management
- **Response Time**: Immediate to 4 hours
- **Common Issues**: Login failures, basic setup problems, permission errors
- **Resolution Tools**: Standard IT procedures, documentation, basic troubleshooting guides

### Level 2: AI Tools Specialists
- **Scope**: Advanced configuration, integration problems, performance optimization
- **Response Time**: 4-24 hours
- **Expertise Areas**: Complex tool setup, workflow integration, advanced feature configuration
- **Resolution Approach**: Specialized knowledge base, advanced diagnostic tools

### Level 3: Vendor Support
- **Scope**: Platform-specific issues, bug reports, feature requests
- **Response Time**: 24-72 hours
- **Direct Access**: GitHub, Cursor, OpenAI, testing platform vendors
- **Escalation Criteria**: Issues requiring vendor code changes or deep platform knowledge

### Level 4: Professional Services
- **Scope**: Complex integrations, custom development, strategic consulting
- **Response Time**: 72+ hours for engagement
- **Services**: Custom solution development, enterprise architecture consulting
- **Engagement Model**: Project-based or retainer consulting arrangements

## Common Issue Resolution Patterns

### GitHub Copilot Issues
```yaml
Issue: "Copilot suggestions not appearing"
Solutions:
  - Check enterprise policy settings
  - Verify user licensing status
  - Restart IDE and clear cache
  - Refresh authentication tokens
```

### Cursor IDE Issues  
```yaml
Issue: "Codebase indexing incomplete"
Solutions:
  - Verify disk space availability
  - Check file permissions
  - Optimize exclusion patterns
  - Restart indexing process
```

## Escalation Decision Framework

Clear criteria for escalating issues between tiers based on complexity, impact, and required expertise level, ensuring optimal resource utilization and fastest resolution times.
