# CheckPoint Maestro NAT Asymmetric Flow Handling

## Core Concept
NAT fundamentally disrupts packet distribution in clustered firewalls by altering source/destination IPs and portsâ€”the exact fields used by Orchestrator distribution algorithms. This creates asymmetric routing where outbound packets route to SGM-A while return packets route to SGM-B, necessitating Correction Layer intervention.

## Distribution Impact by NAT Type
- **No NAT**: <5% correction rate with Layer 3 distribution
- **Source NAT**: 15-30% correction rate with Layer 4 distribution
- **Destination NAT**: 60-70% correction rate with Layer 4 distribution
- **Dual NAT**: 70-100% correction rate requiring ARP rewrite optimization

## Technical Mechanisms
- **Layer 4 distribution mode** examines TCP/UDP ports alongside IP addresses
- **ARP Symmetry** via `asg_unique_mac_utility` prevents MAC flapping during NAT
- **Connection Templates** offload templated connections to SecureXL for performance
- **Correction Table Sizing** scales via `set distribution matrix-size 2048` for >1M connections

## Performance Optimization
- Target <30% correction rates in NAT environments through proper distribution mode configuration
- Monitor correction rates using `show distribution status verbose`
- Avoid Network Mode distribution with NAT as it disables port-based hashing
- Enable ARP rewrite for dual NAT scenarios to minimize correction overhead

## Source Quality
- **Primary Sources**: CheckPoint Maestro Performance Tuning Guide, R81 Administration Guide
