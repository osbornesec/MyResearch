# AI-Specific Incident Response Framework

## Core Concept

AI-specific incident response addresses unique incident types including AI model compromise (model poisoning, adversarial attacks), data poisoning (malicious training data injection), AI hallucination impact (dangerous code generation), privacy violations (AI exposing sensitive data), bias discrimination (harmful AI bias), unauthorized AI access, and AI service disruption, each requiring specialized containment, investigation, and recovery procedures.

## Research Context

Traditional incident response frameworks require adaptation for AI-specific risks that don't fit conventional security incident categories, necessitating specialized response procedures, stakeholder notification processes, and recovery strategies tailored to AI system characteristics.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: AI-Specific Incident Response Framework - Classification and Response Procedures
- **Credibility Score**: 8
- **Validation Method**: Synthesized from AI security research and enterprise incident response best practices

## Connection Potential

Links to security monitoring systems, AI governance committees, ethics review processes, forensics analysis procedures, and system recovery protocols.

## Implementation Notes

Requires immediate response for high/critical severity incidents, specialized containment procedures (isolate AI models, suspend training, preserve artifacts), stakeholder notification including AI ethics committees and privacy officers, and post-incident analysis for continuous improvement of AI-specific response capabilities.

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Created from AI incident response framework analysis
- **Future**: Develop AI-specific forensics capabilities and integrate with emerging AI threat intelligence
