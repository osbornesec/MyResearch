# Express Middleware Organization Pattern

## Core Concept

*Systematic approach to organizing Express.js middleware with clear separation between routing, business logic, and cross-cutting concerns, following proper request-response cycle management and error handling.*

## Content

**What is the core idea?**
Effective Express.js architecture separates middleware into distinct layers: request validation and authentication early in the chain, business logic delegation to service layers, and centralized error handling. Route handlers remain lightweight, focusing on orchestration rather than implementation.

**Why is it important?**
Proper organization provides:
- Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
- Consistent error handling and request validation
- Maintainable codebase with testable components
- Secure authentication and authorization flow
- Standardized response formatting across endpoints

**How does it connect to other concepts?**
Represents fundamental backend architecture principles, integrates with API design patterns, and supports scalable Node.js application development.
