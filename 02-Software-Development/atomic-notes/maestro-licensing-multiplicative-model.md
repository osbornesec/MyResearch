# Maestro Licensing Multiplicative Model

## Core Concept
CheckPoint Maestro follows a multiplicative licensing model where software blades are licensed per Security Gateway Module (SGM), creating linear cost scaling: Number of SGMs × Number of Blades = Total License Count.

## Licensing Structure
- **Orchestrator**: NO LICENSE REQUIRED (hardware cost only)
- **SGM Licensing**: Per-device, MAC address-bound licenses for each gateway
- **Software Blades**: Must be licensed on each individual SGM
- **Multi-Site Impact**: License duplication required for geographic redundancy

## Cost Calculation Example
- 4 SGMs in Security Group
- 3 Required Blades (Firewall, IPS, Threat Emulation)
- Total Licenses: 4 × 3 = 12 blade licenses

## Economic Implications
- **No Economy of Scale**: Software costs scale linearly with deployment size
- **Dual-Site Doubling**: Geographic redundancy roughly doubles licensing investment
- **Planning Requirement**: Must calculate blade licensing across entire planned scale
