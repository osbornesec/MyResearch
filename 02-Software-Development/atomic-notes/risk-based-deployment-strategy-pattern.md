# Risk-Based Deployment Strategy Pattern

## Core Concept

*Systematic risk assessment and mitigation approach for technology deployments, categorizing technical risks (AI hallucinations, vendor lock-in, performance degradation) and business risks (developer resistance, productivity decline, budget overruns) with specific mitigation strategies.*

## Content

**What is the core idea?**
Risk-based deployment strategy systematically identifies and categorizes potential risks across technical and business dimensions, assigns impact and probability assessments, and develops specific mitigation strategies for each identified risk. This includes code review processes for AI hallucinations, multi-vendor strategies for lock-in prevention, and phased rollouts for adoption challenges.

**Why is it important?**
Provides:
- Proactive risk identification and management
- Clear mitigation strategies before issues occur
- Reduced likelihood of project failure or delays
- Stakeholder confidence through transparent risk assessment
- Framework for decision-making under uncertainty

**How does it connect to other concepts?**
Implements enterprise risk management principles, supports project management best practices, and integrates with change management frameworks.
