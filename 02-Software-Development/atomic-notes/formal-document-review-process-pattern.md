# Formal Document Review Process Pattern

## Core Concept

*Structured document review and approval process involving stakeholder inspections, walkthroughs, and structured audits, followed by formal baselining that establishes contractual frameworks, phase-gate controls, and enhanced traceability for audit compliance.*

## Content

**What is the core idea?**
Formal document review ensures accuracy, completeness, and coherence through systematic review by stakeholders, project sponsors, and quality assurance professionals. Upon approval, documents are baselined to create contractual frameworks, enable phase-gate controls, and provide traceability from requirements through implementation and testing.

**Why is it important?**
Provides:
- Quality assurance through systematic review and approval
- Legal and contractual basis for project expectations
- Clear criteria for project milestones and approvals
- Enhanced traceability for audit and regulatory compliance
- Reduced misunderstandings and potential disputes

**How does it connect to other concepts?**
Fundamental to plan-driven methodologies, supports regulatory compliance requirements, and integrates with quality management systems.
