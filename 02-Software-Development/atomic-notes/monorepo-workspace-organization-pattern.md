# Monorepo Workspace Organization Pattern

## Core Concept

*Systematic organization of monorepo workspaces with clear separation of concerns, explicit dependency management, and optimized build orchestration to maintain scalability and development velocity.*

## Content

**What is the core idea?**
Monorepo success depends on proper workspace boundaries with distinct applications (web frontend, API server, specialized services), shared configurations in dedicated packages, and intelligent task orchestration through tools like Turbo to minimize redundant operations.

**Why is it important?**
Proper organization enables:
- Clear separation of concerns between applications
- Efficient CI/CD performance through intelligent caching
- Reduced dependency conflicts and circular dependencies
- Simplified shared configuration management
- Scalable development workflows as the codebase grows

**How does it connect to other concepts?**
This pattern underlies modern full-stack development, integrates with build optimization strategies, and supports enterprise-scale development coordination patterns.
