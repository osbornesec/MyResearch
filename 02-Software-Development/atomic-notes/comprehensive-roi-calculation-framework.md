# Comprehensive ROI Calculation Framework

## Core Concept
Framework for calculating AI coding assistant ROI including total cost of ownership, comprehensive benefit assessment, risk-adjusted calculations, and multiple financial metrics (NPV, IRR, payback period).

## Why This Matters
Accurate ROI calculation justifies AI tool investments and enables optimization of implementation strategies to maximize business value from enterprise AI adoption.

## Implementation Guidance
- Calculate total costs: licenses, implementation, training, infrastructure, opportunity costs
- Measure comprehensive benefits: productivity gains, quality improvements, retention benefits
- Apply risk adjustments for implementation uncertainty and adoption challenges
- Use multiple ROI metrics: simple ROI, NPV, IRR, payback period
- Include future projections and scenario analysis
