# Document Baselining Change Control Pattern

## Core Concept

*Document baselining establishes formally approved specification versions as stable reference points, with subsequent changes requiring formal evaluation, approval, and impact assessment to prevent uncontrolled specification drift.*

## Content

**What is the core idea?**
Baselining creates immutable document versions after formal approval, typically following IEEE 828 configuration management standards. Any modification requires change requests with impact analysis, stakeholder review, and formal approval before updating the baseline. This prevents casual changes that could destabilize downstream work.

**Why is it important?**
This approach provides:
- Specification stability preventing scope creep and requirement drift
- Change impact assessment identifying affected components and teams
- Audit trails for regulatory compliance and quality assurance
- Risk management through controlled modification processes
- Resource protection by preventing rework from unmanaged changes
- Contractual clarity maintaining agreement boundaries

**How does it connect to other concepts?**
Baselining supports BDUF sequential approval processes, enables requirements traceability maintenance, facilitates formal review procedures, and provides foundation for quality management systems.
