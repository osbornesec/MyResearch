# Conversational Coding Workflow Methodologies

## Core Concept

Conversational coding methodologies enable developers to generate, debug, and deploy code through natural language interfaces, using intent-driven development where programmers focus on describing "what" rather than "how" through iterative refinement cycles between human articulation and AI implementation.

## Research Context

This methodology represents the operational foundation of vibe coding culture, transforming the fundamental interaction model between developers and computers from syntax-based programming to natural language conversation, enabling broader accessibility and faster development cycles.
