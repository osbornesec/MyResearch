# Supabase Row Level Security Pattern

## Core Concept

*Comprehensive implementation of Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies at the database level to ensure data access is properly controlled, authenticated, and authorized before reaching application logic.*

## Content

**What is the core idea?**
Supabase RLS provides database-level security by implementing access control policies directly in PostgreSQL, ensuring data protection regardless of how the database is accessed. Policies are defined per table and evaluate user context to determine row-level permissions for read, write, update, and delete operations.

**Why is it important?**
Provides:
- Defense-in-depth security strategy
- Protection against application-level security bugs
- Consistent access control across all database access methods
- Compliance with data protection regulations
- Simplified application logic by moving security to database layer

**How does it connect to other concepts?**
Implements zero-trust security principles, integrates with authentication patterns, and supports multi-tenant application architectures.
