# IEEE 830 SRS Specification Methodology Pattern

## Core Concept

*IEEE 830 Software Requirements Specification methodology provides a standardized framework for comprehensive requirements documentation, establishing functional requirements, non-functional requirements, interface specifications, and system features with formal structure and validation criteria.*

## Content

**What is the core idea?**
IEEE 830 defines systematic SRS structure: Introduction (purpose, scope, definitions), Overall Description (product perspective, functions, user characteristics), Specific Requirements (functional, non-functional, interface requirements), System Features, and supporting appendices. Each requirement must be atomic, testable, and uniquely identifiable.

**Why is it important?**
This methodology provides:
- Comprehensive requirements coverage preventing functional gaps
- Standardized documentation format enabling consistent interpretation
- Formal validation criteria supporting systematic review processes
- Regulatory compliance foundation for safety-critical and regulated systems
- Contractual clarity establishing clear delivery expectations
- Test planning foundation through testable requirement specifications

**How does it connect to other concepts?**
IEEE 830 supports BDUF documentation philosophy, enables requirements traceability frameworks, provides foundation for architectural design, and facilitates formal review processes.
