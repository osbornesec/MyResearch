## Core Concept

Agile methodology is a modern software development approach emphasizing iterative development, continuous customer collaboration, and adaptive planning to respond effectively to changing requirements and deliver working software incrementally.

## Key Characteristics

- **Iterative development in short sprints**: 1-4 week development cycles with working deliverables
- **Continuous customer collaboration**: Regular stakeholder feedback and involvement throughout development
- **Adaptive planning and responding to change**: Embrace requirement changes as learning opportunities
- **Cross-functional, self-organizing teams**: Multi-skilled teams with minimal external dependencies
- **Working software over comprehensive documentation**: Prioritize functional deliverables over extensive documentation

## Best Use Cases

- **Dynamic requirements**: Projects where requirements evolve based on user feedback
- **Startup environments**: Fast-moving organizations with rapid pivot capabilities
- **Customer-facing products**: Applications requiring frequent user experience iterations
- **Innovative projects**: Experimental or research-driven development initiatives

## Implementation Requirements

- **Team Structure**: Small (5-9 people), cross-functional teams with diverse skills
- **Timeline**: Short iteration cycles with frequent delivery milestones
- **Risk Tolerance**: High tolerance for ambiguity and changing priorities
- **Communication**: Daily standups and continuous stakeholder interaction
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing and continuous integration practices

## Core Practices

- **Sprint Planning**: Collaborative session to define iteration scope and goals
- **Daily Standups**: Brief team synchronization meetings
- **Sprint Reviews**: Demonstration of completed work to stakeholders
- **Retrospectives**: Team reflection and process improvement sessions
- **User Stories**: Requirements expressed from end-user perspective

## Advantages

- Rapid response to changing market conditions and user needs
- Early and frequent delivery of working software
- Higher customer satisfaction through continuous engagement
- Improved team morale through autonomy and collaboration

## Disadvantages

- Requires experienced, self-motivated team members
- Can lead to scope creep without proper discipline
- Documentation may be insufficient for complex systems
- Difficulty in long-term planning and resource allocation
