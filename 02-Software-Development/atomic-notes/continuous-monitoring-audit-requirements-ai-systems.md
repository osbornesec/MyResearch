# Continuous Monitoring and Audit Requirements for AI Systems

## Core Concept

Continuous monitoring for AI systems requires comprehensive audit logging of authentication events, AI tool usage events (code suggestions, acceptance/rejection rates), data access events (codebase indexing, sensitive data exposure), administrative events (permission changes, policy modifications), and security events (anomaly detection, violation alerts) with real-time stream processing and automated compliance reporting.

## Research Context

Essential for maintaining security posture and regulatory compliance as AI systems generate high-volume, complex interactions that require automated monitoring and analysis to detect anomalies, policy violations, and security incidents in real-time.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Comprehensive Audit Logging Framework - AI Tools Audit Implementation
- **Credibility Score**: 8
- **Validation Method**: Aligned with enterprise SIEM standards and AI-specific monitoring requirements

## Connection Potential

Connects to SIEM integration, incident response procedures, compliance frameworks, behavioral analytics, and automated alerting systems.

## Implementation Notes

Implement Apache Kafka for stream processing with 30-day retention, real-time analytics with 1-minute to 1-hour window aggregations, alerting rules for authentication anomalies (>5 failed logins in 5 minutes), usage anomalies (>1000 AI requests per hour), and immediate notification for security violations or data exposure events.

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Extracted from comprehensive audit framework implementation guide
- **Future**: Integrate with emerging AI-specific behavioral analytics and threat detection capabilities
