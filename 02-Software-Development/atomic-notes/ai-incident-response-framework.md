# AI Incident Response Framework

## Core Concept
Specialized incident response framework for AI-specific security events including model compromise, data poisoning, privacy violations, bias discrimination, and hallucination impacts.

## Why This Matters
Traditional incident response procedures are insufficient for AI-specific threats requiring specialized containment, investigation, and recovery procedures for AI model and data integrity.

## Implementation Guidance
- Classify incidents: model compromise, data poisoning, privacy violation, bias, unauthorized access
- Implement immediate containment: isolate affected models, suspend training, preserve evidence
- Execute specialized investigation procedures for AI forensics
- Develop AI-specific recovery plans with model restoration capabilities
- Create post-incident analysis process for AI system improvements
