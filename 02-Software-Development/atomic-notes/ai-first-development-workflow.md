# AI-First Development Workflow

## Core Concept
Development methodology that starts with AI-assisted planning, uses intelligent code generation, enables collaborative refinement between developer and AI, and includes automated testing and documentation generation.

## Why This Matters
Transforms traditional development workflows to leverage AI capabilities throughout the entire development lifecycle, maximizing productivity gains and maintaining code quality standards.

## Implementation Guidance
- Phase 1: AI-assisted planning using context from knowledge base
- Phase 2: Intelligent code generation with initial scaffolding
- Phase 3: Collaborative refinement between developer and AI
- Phase 4: AI-powered test generation with 85%+ coverage target
- Phase 5: Automated documentation and review checklist creation
- Implement continuous optimization based on code metrics feedback
