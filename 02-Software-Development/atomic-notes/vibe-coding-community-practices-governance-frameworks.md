# Vibe Coding Community Practices Governance Frameworks

## Core Concept

Vibe coding communities have developed new governance frameworks including Open Source 3.0 with blockchain-based funding and DAO governance, Internal Developer Portals for centralized AI tool management, and AI TRiSM frameworks for trust, risk, and security management of AI-generated code with comprehensive audit trails and compliance verification.

## Research Context

These governance structures represent the institutional evolution necessary to support widespread vibe coding adoption, addressing challenges of code ownership, security validation, and community coordination in AI-assisted development environments.

## Implementation Notes

Key frameworks include blockchain-based contributor incentivization, shared prompt libraries for community development, AI ethics guidelines, and comprehensive audit trails for regulatory compliance. Gartner research indicates 70% of IDPs will fail by 2026 if they prioritize governance over usability.
