# Component-Driven Development with Storybook Architecture

## Core Concept

Component-Driven Development (CDD) through Storybook follows a "Lego block" approach where UIs are built from atomic, reusable components defined as declarative stories in `.stories.js` files, enabling isolated development and testing.

## Architectural Foundation

Storybook's Manager-Preview architecture separates navigation and addon functionality from component rendering, allowing developers to build components in complete isolation from application dependencies. The `.storybook` configuration directory contains `main.js` for addon management and `preview.js` for global styling.

## Story Definition Pattern

Stories represent specific component states as declarative configurations:
```javascript
export const Primary = {
  args: { label: 'Submit', primary: true },
};
export const Disabled = {
  args: { ...Primary.args, disabled: true },
};
```

This pattern enables comprehensive component variation testing without complex application setup.

## Scalability Evidence

Real-world implementations demonstrate significant scale: teams successfully manage 2,000+ story variations with 67.5% build performance improvements through Storybook 7's code splitting architecture.

## Quality Assurance Integration

CDD with Storybook enables automated render tests, interaction testing via play functions, visual regression testing through Chromatic, and accessibility auditing with integrated tools like Axe.
