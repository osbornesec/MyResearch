# Enterprise AI Deployment ROI Pattern

## Core Concept

*Systematic approach to calculating and achieving return on investment for enterprise AI coding assistant deployments, with proven productivity improvements of 50-55% and payback periods of 2-6 months.*

## Content

**What is the core idea?**
Enterprise AI tool deployment follows a predictable ROI pattern: 15-25% productivity gains during initial months, scaling to 35-45% by month 6, and reaching 50-55% sustained improvements by year-end. Investment includes licensing ($39/user/month for GitHub Copilot Enterprise), implementation services ($100K-500K), and training costs.

**Why is it important?**
Provides:
- Quantifiable business case for AI tool adoption
- Realistic timeline expectations for productivity gains
- Framework for measuring deployment success
- Risk-adjusted investment planning
- Benchmark data for organizational comparison

**How does it connect to other concepts?**
Integrates with enterprise change management, productivity measurement frameworks, and technology adoption lifecycle patterns. Supports business case development for digital transformation initiatives.
