# EU AI Act Compliance Framework

## Core Concept
Framework for categorizing AI coding assistants under EU AI Act (2024) as "limited risk" systems requiring transparency, human oversight, and clear documentation of capabilities and limitations.

## Why This Matters
Enterprise AI coding assistant deployments must comply with EU AI Act requirements including transparency obligations, quality measures, and governance structures to avoid regulatory penalties.

## Implementation Guidance
- Classify AI coding assistants as "limited risk" requiring transparency
- Implement meaningful human supervision over AI-generated code
- Document AI capabilities and limitations clearly for users
- Establish cross-functional AI governance board
- Create technical documentation for compliance demonstration
