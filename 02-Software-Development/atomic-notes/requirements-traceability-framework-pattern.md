# Requirements Traceability Framework Pattern

## Core Concept

*Requirements traceability maintains bidirectional links from business needs through requirements, design, implementation, and testing to ensure complete coverage, enable impact analysis, and support regulatory compliance.*

## Content

**What is the core idea?**
Systematic linking creates audit trails: Business Need → Project Charter → SRS Requirement → Design Element → Code Module → Test Case. Every requirement has a unique identifier and traces forward to implementation and backward to business justification, with formal verification matrices tracking coverage.

**Why is it important?**
This framework provides:
- Complete requirements coverage verification preventing missing functionality
- Impact analysis for change requests identifying all affected components
- Regulatory compliance evidence through documented audit trails
- Test planning completeness ensuring every requirement is verified
- Scope control preventing unauthorized feature additions
- Quality assurance through systematic verification matrices

**How does it connect to other concepts?**
Traceability supports BDUF sequential approval processes, enables comprehensive testing strategies, facilitates formal document reviews, and provides foundation for change control mechanisms.
