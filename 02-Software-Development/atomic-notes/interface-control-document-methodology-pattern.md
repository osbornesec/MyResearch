# Interface Control Document Methodology Pattern

## Core Concept

*Interface Control Documents (ICD) formally specify interaction points between system components or external systems, defining APIs, data formats, protocols, timing, and error handling to enable parallel development and seamless integration.*

## Content

**What is the core idea?**
ICDs document "how Component A talks to Component B" with complete specifications including data elements, message formats, communication protocols, timing requirements, error codes, and validation rules. They serve as contracts between development teams enabling parallel work on different components.

**Why is it important?**
This methodology provides:
- Parallel development capability with clear interface contracts
- Integration risk reduction through early interface definition
- Change control for interfaces preventing unilateral modifications
- Test planning foundation for integration testing scenarios
- Documentation of external system dependencies and constraints
- Quality assurance through formal interface validation

**How does it connect to other concepts?**
ICDs emerge from architectural design decisions, support detailed design implementation, enable comprehensive integration testing, and require formal configuration management for contract stability.
