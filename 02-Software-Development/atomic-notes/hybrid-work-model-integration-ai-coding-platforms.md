# Hybrid Work Model Integration AI Coding Platforms

## Core Concept

Hybrid work models in 2025 leverage AI coding platforms to enable seamless distributed collaboration through normalized asynchronous, tool-mediated workflows where remote-first culture intersects with AI-assisted development to create new patterns of team coordination and shared context management across geographic boundaries.

## Research Context

The convergence of remote work culture and AI-assisted development represents a critical enabler of the vibe coding transformation, as distributed teams require different collaboration patterns that AI platforms can uniquely support through shared context and asynchronous code generation.
