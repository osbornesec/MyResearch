# AI-Enhanced Code Velocity Tracking

## Core Concept
Measurement system for tracking development velocity improvements from AI coding assistants, calculating AI assistance ratios, suggestion acceptance rates, and quality-adjusted velocity metrics.

## Why This Matters
Understanding the specific contribution of AI tools to development velocity enables optimization of tool usage and accurate ROI calculation for enterprise AI investments.

## Implementation Guidance
- Track AI assistance ratio: percentage of code written with AI help
- Measure suggestion acceptance rates by tool (Copilot, Cursor)
- Calculate quality-adjusted velocity to account for maintainability
- Monitor AI-generated test coverage and effectiveness
- Implement correlation analysis between AI usage and productivity gains
