## Decision Framework Process

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
1. **Current State Assessment**: Evaluate existing development practices and pain points
2. **Use Case Definition**: Identify specific AI assistance needs across different teams
3. **Constraint Identification**: Document budget, timeline, and technical limitations
4. **Success Criteria**: Define measurable outcomes for AI tool deployment

### Phase 2: Platform Evaluation
1. **Feature Gap Analysis**: Compare platform capabilities against requirements
2. **Pilot Testing**: Conduct limited trials with representative development teams
3. **Cost-Benefit Modeling**: Calculate total cost of ownership and expected ROI
4. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate technical, business, and vendor risks

### Phase 3: Selection and Planning
1. **Platform Selection**: Choose primary and secondary solutions based on evaluation
2. **Implementation Strategy**: Define rollout approach, timeline, and resource allocation
3. **Success Metrics**: Establish KPIs for monitoring platform effectiveness
4. **Contingency Planning**: Prepare alternative approaches if primary choice fails

## Integration Considerations

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Network bandwidth**: Sufficient capacity for AI API calls and model downloads
- **Security configuration**: Firewall rules, endpoint protection, data classification
