# AI Tool Security Compliance Framework

## Core Concept

A comprehensive security and regulatory compliance framework for enterprise AI development tools, encompassing data protection, access control, audit capabilities, and regulatory adherence across multiple compliance standards.

## Security Architecture Components

### Data Protection Layer
- **Encryption Standards**: TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest
- **Access Control**: SSO + MFA authentication, RBAC authorization
- **Session Management**: 8-hour timeout, secure session handling
- **Privacy Controls**: Data residency compliance, 30-day retention policy

### Regulatory Compliance Matrix
- **GDPR**: Data processing agreements, automated deletion rights, explicit consent management
- **SOC2**: Implemented security controls, 24/7 monitoring, annual audits
- **ISO27001**: Quarterly risk assessments, documented policies, incident response procedures

### Network Security Configuration
```yaml
Required Endpoints: Specific HTTPS endpoints for each tool
Firewall Rules: Outbound HTTPS (443) with domain restrictions
Data Classification: Confidential code repos, restricted AI training data
```

## Audit and Monitoring Framework

### Comprehensive Logging
- **Audit Level**: Comprehensive activity logging
- **Retention**: 2-year log retention for compliance
- **Reporting**: Automated SOC2/ISO27001 compliance reporting
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Security incident detection and response

### Policy Enforcement
- **Code Repository Security**: Disable telemetry for sensitive projects
- **Data Governance**: Configure retention policies, implement deletion schedules
- **Access Management**: Role-based permissions, regular access reviews

## Implementation Strategy

Enterprise-grade security framework that balances AI tool functionality with strict compliance requirements, ensuring both productivity gains and regulatory adherence in heavily regulated industries.
