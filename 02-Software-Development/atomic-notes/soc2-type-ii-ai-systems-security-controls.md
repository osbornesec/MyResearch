# SOC 2 Type II Security Controls for AI Systems

## Core Concept

SOC 2 Type II compliance for AI systems requires implementing trust services criteria including security controls (access controls, encryption, network security), availability controls (system monitoring, backup procedures), processing integrity (data accuracy, system functionality), confidentiality (information protection), and privacy controls (data collection, use, retention) with specific considerations for AI model operations and data processing.

## Research Context

SOC 2 Type II certification is increasingly required by enterprise customers for AI service providers, establishing operational effectiveness of security controls over a period of time, particularly important for AI coding assistants that process sensitive enterprise code and data.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Vendor Risk Assessment Framework - SOC 2 Type II Requirements
- **Credibility Score**: 8
- **Validation Method**: Aligned with AICPA SOC 2 Type II audit standards and AI-specific control considerations

## Connection Potential

Connects to vendor assessment criteria, audit and monitoring frameworks, continuous compliance monitoring, and automated evidence collection systems.

## Implementation Notes

Requires annual third-party SOC 2 Type II audits, comprehensive application and infrastructure testing, detailed findings and remediation plans, and specific AI model security controls including data lineage tracking and model integrity verification.

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Extracted from vendor risk management requirements
- **Future**: Monitor evolution of SOC 2 standards for AI-specific controls and emerging audit requirements
