# CI/CD Pipeline Code Review Integration

## Core Concept

*Automated integration of code review processes into continuous integration and deployment pipelines, ensuring quality gates are enforced before code advancement*

## Content

A systematic approach to embedding code review validation directly into CI/CD workflows for consistent quality enforcement:

**Automated Review Integration Points:**
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Local validation before code submission (linting, formatting, basic tests)
- **Pull Request Automation**: Automated checks trigger on PR creation and updates
- **Merge Gate Enforcement**: Blocking deployment until review criteria are satisfied
- **Post-merge Validation**: Continuous monitoring and rollback triggers for quality violations

**Pipeline Quality Gates:**
- **Static Analysis Integration**: Automated code quality scanning with configurable thresholds
- **Test Coverage Validation**: Minimum coverage requirements with trend analysis
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability detection and dependency security assessment
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Automated performance regression detection

**Review Workflow Automation:**
- **Reviewer Assignment**: Intelligent routing based on code ownership and expertise
- **Review Status Tracking**: Automated progress monitoring and escalation procedures
- **Approval Requirements**: Configurable approval rules based on change impact and risk
- **Documentation Generation**: Automated review summary and decision audit trails

**Integration Patterns:**
- **Branch Protection Rules**: Enforced review requirements before merging
- **Deployment Blocking**: Prevent deployment until review completion
- **Quality Metrics Collection**: Automated tracking of review effectiveness and team performance
- **Rollback Automation**: Automated reversion for post-deployment quality violations

**Tool Ecosystem Integration:**
- **Version Control**: GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket webhook integration
- **Quality Tools**: SonarQube, CodeClimate, Codacy integration
- **Communication**: Slack/Teams notifications for review status updates
- **Project Management**: Jira/Azure DevOps integration for traceability

The integration ensures code review becomes an automated, consistent part of the development workflow rather than a manual, error-prone process.
