# Multi-Layer Application Code Review Strategy

## Core Concept

*Systematic approach to reviewing full-stack applications by analyzing each architectural layer with layer-specific criteria and cross-layer integration validation*

## Content

A structured methodology for conducting comprehensive code reviews across multiple application tiers:

**Layer-Specific Review Criteria:**
- **Frontend Layer**: Component composition, state management, rendering optimization, user experience patterns
- **API Layer**: Request/response handling, middleware organization, authentication flows, rate limiting
- **Data Layer**: Schema design, query optimization, security policies, migration management
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Configuration management, deployment patterns, monitoring integration

**Cross-Layer Integration Validation:**
- Data flow consistency between layers
- Security implementation coherence across tiers
- Performance optimization alignment
- Error handling propagation patterns
- Configuration synchronization

**Review Sequencing Strategy:**
1. **Bottom-Up Analysis**: Start with data layer, validate schema and queries
2. **API Contract Validation**: Ensure backend services match frontend requirements
3. **Frontend Integration Review**: Verify client-side implementation aligns with API contracts
4. **End-to-End Flow Analysis**: Trace complete user scenarios across all layers

The strategy ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining focus on layer-specific concerns and integration points that often introduce bugs and security vulnerabilities.
