# Astro Hybrid Rendering Pattern

## Core Concept

*Strategic implementation of Astro's hybrid rendering approach using server-side rendering for content-heavy pages and client-side hydration reserved for interactive components, optimizing performance through selective JavaScript delivery.*

## Content

**What is the core idea?**
Astro 5.7+ hybrid rendering leverages the best of both worlds: server-side rendering for static content and layouts, with client-side interactive islands for dynamic functionality. Components are categorized between server-rendered pages and client-hydrated islands based on interactivity requirements.

**Why is it important?**
Provides:
- Optimal performance through minimal JavaScript delivery
- Better SEO and initial page load times
- Flexible architecture for mixed content types
- Progressive enhancement approach to interactivity
- Efficient resource utilization and bundle optimization

**How does it connect to other concepts?**
Represents modern web development evolution toward performance-first architecture, integrates with component composition patterns, and supports progressive web application strategies.
