# Three-Phase Collaborative Development Pattern

## Core Concept

*Systematic workflow that progresses from broad vision to specific implementation through three distinct phases: Vision Brainstorming, Feature Breakdown, and Implementation Planning, with AI assistance at each stage.*

## Content

**What is the core idea?**
The pattern structures development planning through progressive refinement: Phase 1 explores the overall app concept and technical approach, Phase 2 transforms high-level features into detailed specifications, and Phase 3 creates actionable technical tasks. Each phase builds on previous work while narrowing focus.

**Why is it important?**
This approach provides:
- Comprehensive planning that explores all aspects systematically
- Structured documentation for reference throughout development
- Progressive refinement from broad concepts to specific tasks
- Collaborative ideation that surfaces unconsidered alternatives
- Technical alignment ensuring cohesive system architecture

**How does it connect to other concepts?**
Represents a modern evolution of traditional waterfall planning, integrates AI assistance into SDLC phases, and demonstrates human-AI collaboration patterns for complex problem solving.
