# NIST AI RMF Govern-Map-Measure-Manage Framework Implementation

## Core Concept

The NIST AI Risk Management Framework implements a four-stage process: Govern (establish AI governance structure), Map (identify and categorize AI risks across reliability, safety, fairness, explainability, privacy, and security), Measure (assess identified risks using NIST metrics), and Manage (mitigate identified risks through comprehensive management plans) with cross-category risk synthesis and overall risk score calculation.

## Research Context

Provides the foundational risk management approach for enterprise AI deployments, offering structured methodology to address the complex risk landscape of AI systems while maintaining operational effectiveness and regulatory compliance.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: NIST AI RMF Implementation - Comprehensive Risk Management Framework
- **Credibility Score**: 9
- **Validation Method**: Official NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 standards and implementation guidance

## Connection Potential

Links to AI governance structures, risk assessment methodologies, compliance monitoring systems, and enterprise risk management frameworks.

## Implementation Notes

Requires establishing governance framework with cross-functional expertise, implementing systematic risk categorization across six domains (reliability, safety, fairness, explainability, privacy, security), developing measurement frameworks for each category, and creating comprehensive mitigation strategies with continuous monitoring.

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Extracted from NIST RMF implementation framework
- **Future**: Track NIST AI RMF updates and industry implementation best practices
