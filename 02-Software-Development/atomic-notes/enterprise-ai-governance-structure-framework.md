# Enterprise AI Governance Structure Framework

## Core Concept

Enterprise AI governance requires a cross-functional structure including an AI governance board for strategic oversight, risk assessment committee with technical and legal expertise, compliance monitoring for continuous verification, and AI-specific incident response procedures, with 47% of C-suite executives now establishing AI ethics councils.

## Research Context

This governance structure addresses the emerging need for systematic AI oversight in enterprise environments, particularly as 4.6% of AI budgets are now allocated to ethics and governance, requiring formal organizational structures to manage AI-related risks and compliance obligations.
