# EU AI Act Limited Risk Classification for Enterprise Coding Assistants

## Core Concept

Under the EU AI Act (2024), enterprise AI coding assistants typically fall under the "limited risk" classification, requiring transparency obligations including user notification of AI interaction, clear capability limitations disclosure, meaningful human oversight, and appropriate quality measures for accuracy and robustness.

## Research Context

This classification is crucial for enterprise compliance as it establishes baseline obligations without the more stringent requirements of high-risk AI systems, but still requires documented governance structures, risk assessment committees, and compliance monitoring procedures.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: EU AI Act Compliance Framework (2024) - Security & Compliance Framework Document
- **Credibility Score**: 9
- **Validation Method**: Cross-referenced with official EU AI Act text and enterprise implementation guidance

## Connection Potential

Links to enterprise AI governance frameworks, GDPR compliance requirements, human oversight mechanisms, and automated code generation risk assessment protocols.

## Implementation Notes

Enterprise deployments must establish AI governance boards, implement transparency measures for developers, document AI capability limitations, and maintain compliance monitoring systems with incident response procedures for AI-specific scenarios.

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Created from Security Compliance Framework extraction
- **Future**: Monitor EU AI Act implementation guidance and enforcement patterns for enterprise coding tools
