# CheckPoint Maestro Correction Layer Asymmetric Routing Processing

## Core Concept
The Correction Layer operates as a metadata-driven packet routing system within the Maestro Orchestrator (MHO) that handles asymmetric routing scenarios caused by NAT-induced header changes. When packets arrive at incorrect SGMs due to IP/port modifications, the Correction Layer adds internal headers with connection ownership data and redirects packets to proper SGMs via backplane interfaces.

## Technical Implementation
- **Distributed correction tables** stored across all SGMs map connection identifiers to owner SGMs
- **Four-step process**: Packet arrival → Owner lookup → Orchestrator intervention (if needed) → State synchronization
- **Correction rates**: 87-100% of connections in NAT-enabled deployments require correction
- **Latency impact**: <2μs per corrected packet, viable for 100Gbps+ environments

## Performance Characteristics
- Supports correction rates approaching 100% without performance degradation
- Layer 4 distribution mode reduces misdistribution by 40% compared to pure IP-based distribution
- Dual NAT scenarios result in 70-100% correction rates
- Network Mode distribution with NAT should be avoided as it disables port-based hashing
