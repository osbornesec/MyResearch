# Code Review Quality Gates Framework

## Core Concept

*Structured checkpoint system that defines mandatory quality criteria at different stages of the code review process, preventing low-quality code from advancing to production*

## Content

A systematic framework implementing progressive quality validation through defined checkpoints:

**Tier 1: Fundamental Accuracy Gates**
- Syntax and compilation validation
- Basic functionality verification
- Obvious error elimination
- Currency and relevance confirmation
- Automated tool compliance (linting, formatting)

**Tier 2: Analytical Rigor Gates**
- Logic flow validation and reasoning chain integrity
- Performance impact assessment
- Security vulnerability screening
- Test coverage requirements (minimum thresholds)
- Documentation completeness verification

**Tier 3: Architectural Excellence Gates**
- Design pattern adherence and consistency
- Integration pattern validation
- Scalability and maintainability assessment
- Cross-team review for architectural changes
- Long-term technical debt evaluation

**Gate Enforcement Mechanisms:**
- Automated blocking for Tier 1 failures
- Required human review for Tier 2 progression
- Architect/senior engineer approval for Tier 3 advancement
- Rollback procedures for gate violations discovered post-merge

**Quality Metrics Integration:**
- Defect density tracking per gate level
- Review cycle time optimization
- Quality debt accumulation monitoring
- Team-specific gate customization based on maturity

The framework ensures systematic quality improvement while maintaining development velocity through appropriate automation and human oversight balance.
