# Google Cloud Platform Security Pattern

## Core Concept

*Comprehensive GCP security implementation using Cloud Run with proper resource limits, Secret Manager for sensitive configuration, Vector Search optimization, and Infrastructure as Code for reproducible deployments with security scanning.*

## Content

**What is the core idea?**
GCP security pattern involves proper Cloud Run configuration with appropriate scaling parameters, Secret Manager integration for all sensitive data with access controls and rotation procedures, monitoring and alerting with comprehensive dashboards, and Infrastructure as Code implementation for reproducible, auditable deployments.

**Why is it important?**
Provides:
- Secure cloud-native application deployment
- Proper secrets management and access control
- Scalable and cost-effective resource utilization
- Auditable and reproducible infrastructure changes
- Comprehensive monitoring and incident response capabilities

**How does it connect to other concepts?**
Implements cloud security best practices, supports DevOps automation patterns, and enables enterprise-grade application deployment strategies.
