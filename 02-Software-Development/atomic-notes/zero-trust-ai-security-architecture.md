# Zero Trust AI Security Architecture

## Core Concept
Security architecture that assumes no implicit trust in AI-generated code, implementing continuous authentication, device compliance, network segmentation, and comprehensive monitoring for AI tools.

## Why This Matters
Traditional security models are insufficient for AI coding assistants which generate potentially untrusted code, requiring explicit verification and continuous monitoring of all AI interactions.

## Implementation Guidance
- Implement multi-factor authentication with behavioral biometrics
- Deploy device compliance monitoring with encryption requirements
- Configure network segmentation for AI tool traffic
- Enable SSL inspection and data loss prevention for AI communications
- Apply static and dynamic analysis to all AI-generated code

## Connections
- [[Role-Based Access Control for AI Tools]] - Permission management system
- [[AI Code Security Validation]] - Generated code verification
- [[Enterprise Data Classification]] - Data protection framework
