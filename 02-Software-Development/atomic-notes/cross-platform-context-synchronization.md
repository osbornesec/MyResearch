# Cross-Platform Context Synchronization

## Core Concept
System for synchronizing context across AI tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Jira, Slack) using centralized context store, AI synthesis, and bidirectional updates with conflict resolution.

## Why This Matters
Seamless context sharing between development tools reduces context switching overhead and ensures AI assistants have complete project understanding across all platforms.

## Implementation Guidance
- Implement centralized context store with 30-day active retention
- Use AI synthesizer to unify contexts from multiple platforms
- Enable bidirectional synchronization with conflict resolution
- Trigger updates on commits, documentation changes, and review completion
- Predict context needs proactively based on developer activity patterns
