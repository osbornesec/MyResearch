# Vibe Coding Productivity Metrics Impact Analysis

## Core Concept

Vibe coding implementations demonstrate quantifiable productivity improvements including 20-50% faster feature delivery, 35% reduction in bug resolution time, 25% decrease in defect density, 30-40% development cost reduction, and 68% higher developer satisfaction, with ROI achieved through reduced development costs and faster time-to-market despite 10-20% infrastructure investment increases.

## Research Context

These metrics provide empirical evidence for the business case supporting vibe coding adoption, demonstrating that productivity gains outweigh implementation costs while improving developer satisfaction and code quality across multiple dimensions.
