# Cost-Benefit Analysis Framework Pattern

## Core Concept

*Systematic approach to technology investment analysis including initial setup costs, monthly recurring expenses, expected productivity benefits, and ROI calculations with clear payback period determination for decision-making support.*

## Content

**What is the core idea?**
Cost-benefit analysis framework quantifies technology investments through initial setup costs (licensing, implementation, training), monthly recurring costs (subscriptions, support, maintenance), and expected benefits (productivity gains, cost reductions, quality improvements). The framework calculates net annual benefits, ROI percentages, and payback periods for informed decision making.

**Why is it important?**
Provides:
- Objective financial justification for technology investments
- Clear comparison framework for alternative solutions
- Risk-adjusted financial projections and planning
- Stakeholder alignment through transparent financial analysis
- Framework for ongoing investment performance tracking

**How does it connect to other concepts?**
Supports enterprise financial planning, integrates with technology assessment frameworks, and enables data-driven investment decision making.
