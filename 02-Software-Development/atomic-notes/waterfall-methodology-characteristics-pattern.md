## Core Concept

Waterfall methodology is a traditional software development approach characterized by sequential phases with extensive upfront planning and documentation, following a linear progression through requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance phases.

## Key Characteristics

- **Extensive upfront planning and documentation**: Complete requirements gathering before development begins
- **Phase-gated development with clear milestones**: Formal approval required to proceed between phases
- **Comprehensive requirement specification**: Detailed documentation of all functional and non-functional requirements
- **Formal review and approval processes**: Structured checkpoints with stakeholder sign-offs
- **Strong documentation trail and traceability**: Comprehensive audit trail from requirements to implementation

## Best Use Cases

- **Regulated industries**: Healthcare, finance, aerospace where compliance is critical
- **Large-scale enterprise projects**: Complex systems with multiple stakeholder groups
- **Fixed requirements**: Projects with well-understood, stable requirements
- **Mission-critical systems**: High-reliability systems where failure has severe consequences

## Implementation Requirements

- **Team Structure**: Large, specialized teams with clear role definitions
- **Timeline**: Long development cycles with predictable milestones
- **Risk Tolerance**: Low tolerance for requirement changes or scope creep
- **Documentation**: Extensive technical and process documentation
- **Quality Assurance**: Formal testing and validation procedures

## Advantages

- High predictability for project planning and resource allocation
- Comprehensive documentation supports maintenance and compliance
- Clear accountability through phase-gated approvals
- Suitable for complex system integration requirements

## Disadvantages

- Limited flexibility to accommodate changing requirements
- Late feedback incorporation can lead to expensive rework
- Extended time-to-market for initial deliverable
- Assumes complete understanding of requirements upfront
