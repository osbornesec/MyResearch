# CI/CD GitHub Actions Vercel Integration Patterns

## Core Concept

GitHub Actions can orchestrate Vercel deployments through SDK integration, enabling parallel testing across preview deployments while maintaining production isolation through automated workflow triggers.

## Reference Architecture

```yaml
- name: Deploy Preview
  run: |
    npm exec vercel deploy -- --prebuilt --token $VERCEL_TOKEN
    DEPLOY_URL=$(vercel inspect --token $VERCEL_TOKEN | jq -r '.url')
    echo "DEPLOY_URL=$DEPLOY_URL" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

## Integration Benefits

- **Parallel Testing**: Multiple preview environments for feature branch validation
- **Production Isolation**: Separate deployment targets prevent accidental production deployments
- **Automated Rollbacks**: Integration with GitHub commit history for instant rollback triggers
- **Environment Variables**: Secure token management through GitHub Secrets

## Deployment Strategy

- **Branch-Based**: Automatic preview deployment on pull requests
- **Environment Promotion**: Staging â†’ Production pipeline with approval gates
- **Atomic Operations**: Each deployment is either fully successful or fully rolled back

## Operational Considerations

- **Rate Limits**: GitHub Actions concurrency limits interact with Vercel deployment quotas
- **Secret Management**: VERCEL_TOKEN rotation and access control policies
- **Monorepo Support**: Custom file upload strategies for large codebases (50k+ files)

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: GitHub Actions Documentation + Vercel Integration Guides
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10
- **Validation Method**: Community implementation patterns and best practices analysis
