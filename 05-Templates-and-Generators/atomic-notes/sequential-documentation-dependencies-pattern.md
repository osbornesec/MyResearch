# Sequential Documentation Dependencies Pattern

## Core Concept

A systematic methodology for creating software documentation in proper dependency order, where each document builds upon previously approved documents through 10 distinct phases with formal phase gates, ensuring comprehensive requirements traceability and architectural integrity.

## Content

**Pattern Definition**: The Sequential Documentation Dependencies Pattern establishes a rigorous sequence for software documentation creation, where each document has specific prerequisites and must be completed and approved before moving to dependent phases, preventing gaps and ensuring systematic development.

**Core Dependency Architecture**:

1. **Phase Gates System**: 10 formal approval checkpoints that prevent progression without complete prerequisites
2. **Document Traceability**: Each document explicitly depends on and references previous phase outputs
3. **Baseline Management**: Once approved, documents become "baselined" requiring formal change control
4. **Impact Analysis**: Changes require evaluation across all dependent documents

**Sequential Phase Structure**:

**Foundation Phases (1-2)**:
- Project Charter → Business Requirements → Feasibility Study
- Dependencies: Charter authorizes all subsequent work, BRD provides requirements foundation

**Requirements Definition (3-4)**:
- Software Requirements Specification → Use Cases → Traceability Matrix → Data Dictionary
- Dependencies: SRS requires approved BRD, all others build from SRS

**Architecture Design (5-8)**:
- System Architecture → Data Architecture → Security Architecture → Interface/API Specifications
- Dependencies: All require approved SRS, each builds specialized architectural view

**Implementation Planning (9-10)**:
- Test Planning → Project Management Planning → Development Planning
- Dependencies: Require complete architecture, establish implementation framework

**Critical Success Principles**:
- **Sequential Creation**: Never skip phases or leave documents partially complete
- **Formal Reviews**: Each document undergoes stakeholder review before approval
- **Complete Coverage**: All 30 document types must be addressed or explicitly deferred
- **Change Control**: Approved documents require formal impact analysis for modifications

**Quality Assurance Framework**:
- Prerequisite verification before document creation begins
- Stakeholder review and approval processes
- Traceability maintenance across document dependencies
- Version control and baseline management

**Benefits of Strict Sequencing**:
- **Risk Reduction**: Prevents downstream rework from incomplete upstream analysis
- **Quality Assurance**: Each phase builds on verified foundation
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Formal approvals ensure consensus before progression
- **Audit Trail**: Complete traceability from business need to implementation

**Common Anti-Patterns Prevented**:
- Starting detailed design before requirements approval
- Implementing without architectural review
- Testing without complete specifications
- Deployment without operational readiness

**Why Essential**: Sequential dependencies prevent the chaos of ad-hoc documentation, ensuring that each piece of work builds on a solid, approved foundation and that all stakeholders maintain alignment throughout the development process.
