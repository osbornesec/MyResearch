# Project Charter Prompt

**Context:** The project charter is the foundational document that officially authorizes the project and serves as a reference point for all subsequent documentation. It defines high-level requirements, objectives, scope, and success criteria. This document is crucial as it establishes the project's authority, secures initial resources, and aligns stakeholder expectations before detailed planning begins.

**Required Expertise Persona:** As a Senior Program Director with 16+ years of experience initiating and governing strategic projects across multiple industries, you possess deep expertise in project chartering and organizational alignment. Your background includes successfully launching complex, high-visibility initiatives where clear scope definition and stakeholder alignment were critical success factors. You excel at translating business vision into concrete project objectives and have extensive experience obtaining executive sponsorship for major initiatives. Your ability to balance stakeholder needs with organizational constraints ensures project charters that are both ambitious and realistic. Your knowledge of project governance structures, resource allocation strategies, and success criteria definition enables you to create authoritative project charters that effectively launch projects and serve as trusted reference points throughout the project lifecycle.

**Prompt:**
```
I need you to create a comprehensive Project Charter for [project name]. 

First, take a step back and consider the fundamental principles that make an effective project charter. What are the 3-5 key characteristics that define successful project initiation documents? Briefly explain why these principles matter for project success.

Now, working step by step through each section, create a complete Project Charter that follows these principles:

1. Executive Summary: Concisely describe the project's purpose and business case.
2. Project Purpose/Vision: Establish clear objectives that are specific, measurable, and aligned with organizational goals.
3. Scope and Boundaries: Define what is included and explicitly excluded from the project, considering both functionality and constraints.
4. Stakeholder Information: Identify all relevant parties and their roles, especially focusing on decision-makers and approvers.
5. Project Timeline: Outline high-level milestones with estimated durations (not detailed scheduling).
6. Resource Requirements: Estimate budgetary needs, personnel, and other resources.
7. Constraints and Assumptions: Document limitations and presumptions affecting the project.
8. Risk Assessment: Identify preliminary risks and potential mitigation approaches.
9. Success Criteria: Define concrete, measurable indicators that will determine project completion and success.
10. Approval Section: Include placeholder for stakeholder signatures.

For each section, explain your reasoning process as you develop the content, and ensure all elements work together cohesively. The document should be concise (aim for 3-5 pages) but comprehensive.

After completing the initial draft, review the document against these validation criteria:
- Does it clearly connect project objectives to business goals?
- Are scope statements specific and measurable?
- Have all major stakeholders been identified?
- Are success criteria measurable and achievable?
- Are all relevant project constraints identified?

Based on this validation, refine any sections that need improvement. Format the final document using markdown with clear section headings.
