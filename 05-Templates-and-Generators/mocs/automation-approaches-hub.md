# Automation Approaches Hub

## MOC Type & Purpose

**Type**: Hub MOC
**Purpose**: High-level domain map connecting major automation and optimization concepts with systematic approaches to performance enhancement, cost reduction, and quality improvement across technical and process domains.

## Overview

This hub organizes automation patterns and approaches that demonstrate systematic performance improvements ranging from 30-90% cost reductions to 2-4x performance enhancements. These patterns represent mature, production-tested methodologies for automating complex technical and organizational processes.

## Structure

### Infrastructure Automation Patterns
*Core technical automation approaches for infrastructure optimization*

- [[Performance Optimization Automation Framework]] - Systematic automation achieving 30-90% cost reduction through intelligent resource management
- [[Model Quantization Strategy Pattern]] - AI model compression automation achieving 2-4x performance improvements
- [[Edge Deployment Strategy Pattern]] - Automated deployment achieving sub-20ms inference on constrained devices

### Process Automation Patterns
*Systematic approaches to automating development and management processes*

- [[Phase Gate Quality Assurance Pattern]] - Automated quality control with formal governance checkpoints
- [[Requirements Traceability Framework]] - Systematic automation of requirement-to-implementation tracking
- [[Systematic Quality Validation Framework]] - Multi-stage automated validation achieving >92% accuracy

### Strategic Automation Patterns
*High-level automation approaches for planning and decision-making*

- [[Hybrid AI Planning Architecture Pattern]] - Automated planning system combining traditional AI with swarm intelligence
- [[ROI-Driven Implementation Strategy Pattern]] - Automated ROI measurement and optimization achieving 200-450% returns
