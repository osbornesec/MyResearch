# Project Management Plan (PMP) Prompt

**Context:** The Project Management Plan is the master planning and control document for the project, describing how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled. It encompasses scope, schedule, resources, risk management, quality assurance, and other management aspects. The PMP provides the framework for all project activities and ensures alignment between technical development and project objectives.

**Required Expertise Persona:** As a certified PMP-holding Senior Project Manager with 15+ years of experience in software development projects, you possess comprehensive expertise in project planning and execution within structured methodologies. You have successfully managed large-scale, mission-critical systems with strict governance requirements. Your experience includes leading cross-functional teams, managing complex stakeholder relationships, and navigating organizational policies. You excel at integrating technical development processes with business objectives and have a proven track record of delivering projects under stringent quality standards. Your knowledge of industry-standard project management frameworks (PMI, Prince2) enables you to create robust planning documents that facilitate both execution and governance.

**Prompt:**
```
I need you to create a comprehensive Project Management Plan (PMP) for [project name].

Before diving into specific planning details, take a step back and consider: What fundamental principles make an effective project management plan in a structured development methodology? What key elements ensure that project execution remains aligned with requirements while maintaining control over scope, schedule, and resources? Outline these core principles and explain why they're crucial for project success.

   - Explain your scheduling approach and time management strategy

7. Resource Management:
   - Resource Requirements: Detail personnel, equipment, and materials needed
   - Resource Allocation: Map resources to activities
   - Resource Leveling: Explain how resource conflicts are resolved
   - Walk through your resource planning methodology

8. Budget and Cost Management:
   - Cost Baseline: Present the approved project budget
   - Cost Breakdown: Detail costs by category and phase
   - Cost Control: Explain processes for tracking and controlling costs
   - Explain your approach to financial management

9. Risk Management:
   - Risk Management Approach: Define the risk management methodology
   - Risk Register: Document identified risks with probability and impact
   - Risk Response Strategies: Detail mitigation and contingency plans
   - Risk Monitoring: Explain ongoing risk tracking procedures
   - Walk through your risk assessment methodology

10. Quality Management:
    - Quality Objectives: Define quality targets for the project
    - Quality Assurance: Detail processes to ensure quality
    - Quality Control: Specify inspection and testing procedures
    - Quality Metrics: Define measurements for quality assessment
    - Explain your strategy for ensuring deliverable quality

11. Change Management:
    - Change Control Process: Define procedures for handling changes
    - Change Control Board: Identify members and their authority
    - Change Impact Assessment: Explain how changes are evaluated
    - Change Documentation: Detail how changes are recorded
    - Walk through your approach to maintaining baseline integrity

12. Configuration Management:
    - Configuration Items: Identify items under configuration control
    - Version Control: Define version management procedures
    - Baseline Management: Explain how baselines are established and maintained
    - Explain your configuration management strategy

13. Communication Management:
    - Communication Requirements: Identify information needs
    - Communication Matrix: Define who receives what information when
    - Communication Methods: Specify formats and technologies

After completing the initial draft, validate the document against these criteria:
- Does the plan align with the Project Charter and organizational standards?
- Are all project management knowledge areas addressed?
- Is the schedule realistic and does it account for dependencies?
- Are responsibilities clearly assigned for all activities?
- Is the risk management approach comprehensive?
- Are quality controls adequate for project requirements?
- Is the change management process rigorous enough for a BDUF approach?
- Does the communication plan address all stakeholder needs?

Based on this validation, refine any sections requiring improvement. Format the final document using markdown with clear section headings, tables, and a consistent structure throughout.
