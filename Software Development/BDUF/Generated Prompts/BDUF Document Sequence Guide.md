# BDUF Methodology: A Guide to Using Generated Prompts in Sequence

This guide outlines how to use the Generated Prompts in the proper sequence to fully implement a Big Design Up Front (BDUF) methodology in your software development project.

## Introduction to BDUF Document Flow

The BDUF methodology requires creating comprehensive documentation before implementation begins. Each document has specific dependencies and must be completed and approved before moving to the next phase. Following this sequence ensures proper requirements traceability, architectural integrity, and systematic development.

## Key Principles for Using BDUF Generated Prompts

1. **Sequential Creation**: Follow the document sequence strictly - each document builds upon previously approved documents.

2. **Complete Each Document Fully**: Resist the temptation to skip ahead or leave documents partially complete.

3. **Formal Reviews**: Each document should undergo formal review by appropriate stakeholders.

4. **Baseline Management**: Once approved, documents become "baselined" and require formal change control for modifications.

5. **Traceability Maintenance**: Ensure requirements flow down through all documents with clear traceability.

6. **Impact Analysis**: When changes occur, analyze impacts on all dependent documents.

7. **Documentation Updates**: When changes are approved, update all affected documents before proceeding.

## Using the Generated Prompts Effectively

1. For each document, use the corresponding prompt from the Generated Prompts directory.

2. Ensure you have completed and received approval for prerequisite documents.

3. Provide relevant information from prerequisite documents as context when using the prompts.

4. Use the validation criteria in each prompt to verify document quality.

5. Have appropriate stakeholders review and approve each document.

6. Only move to the next document in sequence after formal approval of predecessors.

By following this sequence and using the Generated Prompts as directed, you will implement a comprehensive BDUF methodology that ensures thorough planning, clear requirements, solid architecture, and systematic development of your software system.
