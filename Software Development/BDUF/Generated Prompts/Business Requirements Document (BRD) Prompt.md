**Prompt:**
```
I need you to create a comprehensive Business Requirements Document (BRD) for [project name].

Before beginning, take a step back and consider: What fundamental business analysis principles should guide requirements gathering? What makes business requirements effective for driving successful projects? Outline these core principles and explain why they're essential for translating business needs into effective solutions.

Now, working methodically through the requirements gathering process, create a detailed BRD with these sections:

1. Executive Summary: Provide a concise overview of the business need and proposed solution.

2. Project Background:
   - Explain the business context and history leading to this project
   - Identify the business problem or opportunity being addressed
   - Walk through your reasoning about why this project matters to the organization

3. Business Objectives:
   - Define specific, measurable business goals
   - Explain how each objective connects to organizational strategy
   - Show your chain of thought linking objectives to business value

4. Current State Analysis:
   - Document existing processes, systems, and pain points
   - Include process flows for key business functions
   - Explain your analytical approach to understanding the current state

5. Future State Vision:
   - Describe the desired business state after implementation
   - Explain the reasoning behind your vision for the future state
   - Connect this vision to business objectives

6. Business Requirements:
   - For each requirement:
     - Assign a unique identifier for traceability
     - Categorize appropriately (functional, process, reporting, etc.)
     - Define acceptance criteria
     - Prioritize based on business value
     - Explain your reasoning for priority and categorization
   - Organize requirements logically by business function or process
   - Ensure each requirement is specific, measurable, and aligned with objectives

7. Stakeholder Analysis:
   - Identify all affected parties and their interests
   - Document key stakeholder needs and concerns
   - Explain how stakeholder needs influenced requirements

8. Constraints and Assumptions:
   - Document business, regulatory, and operational constraints
   - List assumptions made during requirements gathering
   - Explain how these factors impact the proposed solution

9. Project Scope:
   - Define clear boundaries of what will and won't be delivered
   - Explain your reasoning for scope decisions

10. Glossary:
    - Define business terms and acronyms
    - Ensure consistent terminology throughout

After completing the initial draft, validate the document against these criteria:
- Are requirements clear, concise, and unambiguous?
- Is each requirement testable and verifiable?
- Do requirements comprehensively cover all business needs?
- Are there conflicts or contradictions between requirements?
- Are all requirements aligned with stated business objectives?
- Are requirements properly prioritized based on business value?

Based on this validation, refine any sections that need improvement. Format the final document using markdown with clear section headings and a consistent structure.
