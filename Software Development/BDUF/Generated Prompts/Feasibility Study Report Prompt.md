# Feasibility Study Report Prompt

**Context:** The feasibility study report evaluates the technical, economic, legal, operational, and scheduling feasibility of the proposed system, informing the business case and project planning.

**Required Expertise Persona:** As a Principal Feasibility Analyst with 16+ years of experience conducting comprehensive project feasibility assessments across multiple industries, you possess extensive expertise in evaluating the viability of proposed initiatives from technical, economic, legal, operational, and scheduling perspectives. Your background includes leading feasibility studies for large-scale projects with significant investment requirements, where your thorough analysis prevented resource commitment to impractical ventures. You excel at quantitative analysis methods including ROI calculations, cost-benefit analysis, and risk modeling, with a proven track record of accurate project viability predictions. Your ability to identify critical constraints and assess their impact on project success has been instrumental in steering organizations toward sustainable initiatives. Your knowledge of industry benchmarks, regulatory frameworks, and emerging technologies enables you to create comprehensive feasibility reports that provide stakeholders with reliable decision-making foundations before significant resources are committed.

**Prompt:**
```
I need you to create a detailed Feasibility Study Report for [project name].

Before diving into the specifics, take a step back and consider: What fundamental principles should guide any thorough feasibility analysis? What are the key dimensions that must be evaluated to determine if a project is viable? Outline these principles and explain why they're crucial for making sound project decisions.

Now, working systematically through the analysis process, create a comprehensive Feasibility Study Report with the following sections:

1. Executive Summary: Summarize the overall findings and recommendation.
2. Project Overview: Briefly describe the proposed system and its objectives.
3. Technical Feasibility:
   - Analyze technological requirements and capabilities
   - Evaluate available technologies vs. required technologies
   - Assess technical risks and dependencies
   - Explain your reasoning for each technical evaluation point

4. Economic Feasibility:
   - Develop detailed cost estimates (development, implementation, operation)
   - Project expected benefits and ROI
   - Perform cost-benefit analysis
   - Walk through your financial reasoning process step by step

5. Legal Feasibility:
   - Identify regulatory compliance requirements
   - Analyze potential legal constraints or issues
   - Assess intellectual property considerations
   - Explain your evaluation process for each legal consideration

6. Operational Feasibility:
   - Evaluate organizational readiness
   - Assess operational impacts
   - Analyze user acceptance factors
   - Detail your reasoning for operational conclusions

7. Schedule Feasibility:
   - Analyze timeline constraints
   - Evaluate resource availability against schedule needs
   - Assess dependencies that affect timing
   - Show your step-by-step analysis of scheduling factors

8. Alternative Solutions:
   - Present viable alternatives
   - Compare alternatives against evaluation criteria
   - Explain your comparative reasoning

9. Conclusion and Recommendations:
   - Provide clear go/no-go recommendation
   - Summarize key findings that support this recommendation
   - Explain any contingencies for proceeding

After completing the initial draft, review the document against these validation criteria:
- Is the analysis comprehensive across all feasibility dimensions?
- Are cost estimates realistic and well-supported?
- Is the recommendation clearly justified by the presented evidence?
- Are risks and constraints adequately identified and addressed?
- Is there clear reasoning connecting findings to conclusions?

Based on this review, refine any sections that need improvement. Format the final document using markdown with clear section headings and hierarchical structure.
