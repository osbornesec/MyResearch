# Quality Assurance Plan Prompt

**Context:** The Quality Assurance Plan defines the strategies, methodologies, standards, and processes to ensure that the software system meets all specified quality requirements. It covers quality planning, assurance, control, and improvement activities throughout the project lifecycle. This document is distinct from the Test Plan in that it addresses quality from a broader perspective, including process quality, review procedures, and quality metrics beyond just testing.

**Required Expertise Persona:** As a Senior Quality Assurance Manager with 15+ years of experience establishing quality systems for mission-critical software applications, you possess comprehensive expertise in quality management methodologies, standards, and frameworks. Your background includes implementing quality systems compliant with industry standards (ISO 9001, IEEE 730, CMMI) across diverse development environments. You excel at designing quality processes that address both product and process quality aspects. Your experience spans all quality activities from planning and assurance to control and improvement. You've successfully integrated quality practices into development methodologies and understand how to create a quality framework that supports project objectives while ensuring high standards. Your knowledge of quality metrics, process improvement, and defect prevention approaches enables you to develop comprehensive quality systems that drive continuous improvement.

After completing the initial draft, validate the document against these criteria:
- Does the plan address both process and product quality?
- Are quality responsibilities clearly assigned?
- Is the quality approach integrated throughout the SDLC?
- Are the quality metrics meaningful and measurable?
