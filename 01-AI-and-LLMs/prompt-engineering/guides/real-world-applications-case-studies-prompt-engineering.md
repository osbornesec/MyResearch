- Performance: Consider performance implications of all suggestions
- Accessibility: Include ARIA attributes for interactive elements
- Responsive Design: Ensure mobile-first responsive design

## Team Conventions
- Naming: Use camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components
- File Organization: Group by feature, not by file type
- Import Order: External imports, internal imports, relative imports
- Comments: Explain 'why' not 'what' in comments
```

*Results:*
- **78% reduction** in AI hallucination incidents

        ## CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
        
        **Input Validation:**
        - Validate all inputs according to expected data types and ranges
        - Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, Command Injection)
        - Use parameterized queries for database operations
        - Implement proper input length limits
        
        **Authentication & Authorization:**
        - Never hardcode credentials or API keys
        - Implement proper session management
        - Use secure authentication mechanisms (OAuth 2.0, JWT with proper validation)
        - Implement role-based access control where applicable
        
        **Data Protection:**
        - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
        - Use secure random number generation for tokens/IDs
        - Implement proper key management
        - Never log sensitive information
        
        **Error Handling:**
        - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
        - Implement proper logging for security events
        - Use generic error messages for user-facing errors
        - Include proper audit trails
        
        **Specific Security Measures for this context:**
        {self._format_context_specific_requirements(security_requirements)}
        
        **FORBIDDEN PATTERNS:**
        - eval() or similar dynamic code execution
        - String concatenation for SQL queries
        - Hardcoded secrets or credentials
        - Unvalidated redirects or forwards
        - Insecure direct object references

**Next-Generation AI Coding Platforms:**

The landscape of AI coding assistance is rapidly evolving with several emerging technologies showing significant promise:

**1. Agentic Workflows and Multi-Agent Systems:**

```python
class NextGenAICodeAgent:
    """
    Future AI coding agent with advanced reasoning and planning capabilities.
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.planning_agent = PlanningAgent()
        self.implementation_agent = ImplementationAgent()
        self.testing_agent = TestingAgent()
        self.review_agent = ReviewAgent()
        self.coordination_system = AgentCoordinationSystem()
        
    def autonomous_feature_development(self, feature_request: str,
                                     project_context: Dict) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Autonomously develop features using coordinated AI agents.
        """
        # Planning phase
        development_plan = self.planning_agent.create_development_plan(
            feature_request, project_context
        )
        
        # Implementation coordination
        implementation_results = self.coordination_system.coordinate_implementation(
            development_plan, [self.implementation_agent, self.testing_agent]
        )
        
        # Quality assurance
        review_results = self.review_agent.comprehensive_review(
            implementation_results, development_plan
        )
        
        return {
            'development_plan': development_plan,
            'implementation': implementation_results,
            'quality_review': review_results,
            'deployment_readiness': self._assess_deployment_readiness(review_results)
        }
```

**2. Context-Aware Intelligent Development Environments:**

Future IDEs will provide unprecedented context awareness and intelligent assistance:

```python
class ApplicationGenerationPlatform:
    """
    Future platform for generating complete applications from natural language.
    """
    
    def generate_application(self, description: str,
                           requirements: Dict,
                           constraints: Dict) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Generate complete application from natural language description.
        """
        # Architecture design
        architecture = self.architecture_designer.design_from_description(
            description, requirements, constraints
        )
        
        # Code generation
        codebase = self.code_generator.generate_full_application(
            architecture, requirements
        )
        
        # Testing and validation
        test_suite = self.test_generator.generate_comprehensive_tests(
            codebase, requirements
        )
        
        # Documentation
        documentation = self.documentation_generator.generate_docs(
            codebase, architecture, requirements
        )
        
        return {
