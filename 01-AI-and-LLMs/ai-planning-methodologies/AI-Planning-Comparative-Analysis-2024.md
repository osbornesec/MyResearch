## Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis evaluates AI-powered software development planning approaches across five critical dimensions: technical architecture, performance benchmarks, economic viability, use case suitability, and strategic implementation. Through parallel specialized research streams, we examined LLM-based planning systems (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) versus specialized planning frameworks, hybrid architectures, and emerging approaches.

**Key Findings:**
- **LLM-based systems** achieve 12-30% autonomous planning success rates but excel as heuristic guides (77% accuracy with PLaG prompting)
- **Specialized planners** maintain 60-82% success rates in structured domains with predictable TCO
- **Hybrid architectures** demonstrate optimal balance, achieving 92% success in multi-step robotics tasks
- **Economic breakeven** occurs at 18 months for high-usage scenarios favoring classical systems
- **Strategic selection** depends critically on project complexity, regulatory requirements, and organizational maturity
