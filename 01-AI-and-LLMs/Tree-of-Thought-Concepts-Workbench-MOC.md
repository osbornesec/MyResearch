## MOC Type & Purpose

**Type**: Workbench MOC
**Purpose**: Active synthesis space for organizing Tree-of-Thought concepts extracted from comprehensive source material. This demonstrates the smart extraction methodology in action.

## Overview

This workbench organizes atomic concepts extracted from the comprehensive Tree-of-Thought guide, showing how complex research documents can be decomposed into reusable, linkable knowledge components while preserving the original source material.

## Core Concepts (Extracted Atomics)

### Foundational Theory
- [[Cognitive Science Foundations of Tree-of-Thought]] - Why this approach aligns with human reasoning
- [[Tree-of-Thought vs Chain-of-Thought Performance]] - Empirical evidence for effectiveness

### Implementation Framework  
- [[Tree-of-Thought Four Essential Components]] - Architectural requirements for implementation

## Source Material
- #source [[Tree-of-Thought Complete Guide]] - Original comprehensive implementation guide (2,876 lines)

## Extraction Methodology Demonstration

### What Was Extracted
1. **Performance Evidence**: Concrete benchmarks showing ToT superiority
2. **Architectural Framework**: Essential components needed for implementation  
3. **Theoretical Foundation**: Cognitive science basis for the approach

### What Was Preserved
- Complete implementation examples and code
- Detailed use cases and applications
- Step-by-step tutorials and guides
- Tool comparisons and platform analysis

### Smart Extraction Benefits
1. **Atomic concepts** can be linked from other notes without referencing 2,876-line document
2. **Key insights** are now discoverable through search and graph navigation
3. **Reusable knowledge** components work across multiple contexts
4. **Source material** remains intact as comprehensive reference

## Active Questions

1. Which additional concepts from the source guide merit atomic extraction?
2. How do these ToT concepts connect to other AI reasoning frameworks in the vault?
3. What implementation patterns emerge when these atomic concepts are combined?
4. How can this extraction methodology be applied to other comprehensive guides?

## Synthesis Notes

### Extraction Pattern Recognition
The ToT extraction reveals a pattern for complex methodology documents:
- **Performance evidence** → Atomic note with benchmarks
- **Core architecture** → Atomic note with components  
- **Theoretical foundation** → Atomic note with principles
- **Implementation details** → Remain in comprehensive source

### Connection Opportunities
These atomic ToT concepts connect to:
- Other prompt engineering frameworks (Chain-of-Thought, ReAct)
- Cognitive science research on problem-solving
- AI coding methodology patterns
- Software architecture decision-making processes

### Future Extractions
Additional concepts that could become atomic notes:
- ToT search strategies (breadth-first vs depth-first)
- Evaluation criteria frameworks
- Domain-specific application patterns
- Tool integration strategies

## Maintenance

- **Note Count**: 3 atomic extracts from 1 source
- **Last Review**: 2025-06-13
- **Next Review**: 2025-06-20
- **Health**: Growing - demonstrates extraction methodology
