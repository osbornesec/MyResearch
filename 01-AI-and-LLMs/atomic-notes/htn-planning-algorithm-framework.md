# HTN Planning Algorithm Framework

## Core Concept

Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning represents a formal framework for automated task decomposition where complex goals are systematically broken down into executable primitive actions through structured method application and constraint satisfaction.

## Formal Framework Components

### Domain Definition Structure
An HTN domain D = (T_p, T_c, M) consists of:
- **T_p**: Set of primitive tasks (directly executable actions)
- **T_c**: Set of compound tasks (requiring decomposition)  
- **M**: Set of methods for task reduction

### Task Network Architecture
A task network N = (T, ≺, α) contains:
- **T**: Set of task instances
- **≺**: Partial ordering constraints
- **α**: Variable bindings

## Algorithm Implementations

### SHOP2 Total-Order Planning
```
Algorithm: SHOP2-Plan
Input: Task list L, Current state S
Output: Plan P or failure

1. If L is empty, return empty plan
2. Select first task t from L
3. If t is primitive:
   a. Check preconditions in S
   b. Apply effects to get S'
   c. Return t + SHOP2-Plan(L-{t}, S')
4. If t is compound:
   a. Find applicable method m
   b. Decompose t using m to get subtasks
   c. Return SHOP2-Plan(subtasks + L-{t}, S)
```

### PANDA Partial-Order Planning
Maintains task networks with partial ordering, enabling parallel execution opportunities and flexible constraint satisfaction.

## Computational Characteristics

**Complexity Analysis**: HTN planning is undecidable in the general case but becomes polynomial-time decidable for acyclic task networks with bounded methods, making practical implementations require careful domain design for tractability.

## Software Development Applications

HTN planning naturally maps to software development hierarchies: projects decompose into features, features into components, components into functions, enabling automated project planning and task allocation.
