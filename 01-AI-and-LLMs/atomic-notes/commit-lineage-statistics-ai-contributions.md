# Commit Lineage Statistics for AI Contributions

## Core Concept
Scripts parse Git logs for AI markers (e.g., "(ai)" suffix) to calculate lines added/deleted by AI versus humans, generating JSON/CSV reports for analysis and enabling quantitative assessment of AI influence in code evolution.

## Research Context
Data-driven approach to understanding AI impact on development processes, providing quantitative metrics for performance analysis, accountability tracking, and development process optimization.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Specialized Version Control and Change Management for AI-Generated Code
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10
- **Validation Method**: Git analytics implementation studies

## Connection Potential
- Links to repository telemetry dashboards
- Connects to attribution API development
- Relates to AI-tagged commit systems
- Bridges to performance measurement frameworks

## Implementation Details
- **Log Parsing**: Automated extraction of AI markers from Git commit history
- **Contribution Calculation**: Lines added/deleted metrics for AI vs human work
- **Report Generation**: JSON/CSV outputs for analysis and visualization
- **Quantitative Assessment**: Data-driven understanding of AI influence
- **Process Optimization**: Insights for development workflow improvement
