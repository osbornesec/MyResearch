# Automatic Prompt Engineering Meta-Optimization

## Core Concept
Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) uses AI systems to generate and optimize prompts automatically, representing a meta-level approach that can discover prompts more effective than human-crafted ones. APE automates the iterative refinement loop, where systems generate, evaluate, and refine prompts without human intervention.

## Research Context
APE frameworks like OPRO (Google DeepMind) allow different LLMs to try different prompts before finding suitable choices. This automation of the refinement loop can accelerate prompt optimization and discover novel prompting strategies that human engineers might not consider.
