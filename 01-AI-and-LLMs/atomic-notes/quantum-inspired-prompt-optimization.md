### What is Quantum-Inspired Prompt Optimization?

Quantum-inspired prompt optimization applies quantum computing concepts to prompt engineering without requiring actual quantum hardware. This approach uses mathematical analogies to quantum phenomena for more sophisticated optimization strategies.

**Core Quantum Concepts Applied:**
- **Superposition**: Simultaneous exploration of multiple prompt variants
- **Entanglement**: Coordinated optimization of related prompt components
- **Quantum Tunneling**: Escape from local optima through barrier penetration
- **Quantum Evolution**: Guided optimization using quantum algorithm principles
