## Core Concept

Claude Code supports flexible team collaboration through structured workflows including Explore-Plan-Code-Commit patterns, Test-Driven Development approaches, and coordinated repository management with explicit AI interaction documentation and knowledge sharing protocols.

## Research Context

Essential for development teams implementing AI-assisted collaborative workflows. Enables systematic team adoption and productivity optimization strategies.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Best practices documentation and team collaboration case studies
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10
- **Validation Method**: Multiple team implementation studies and workflow analysis

## Implementation Notes

**Core Workflow Patterns**:

**Explore-Plan-Code-Commit Pattern**:
- Exploration: Team uses Claude to explore files and project resources
- Planning: Structured prompts with "think" commands for solution design
- Implementation: Claude generates code based on collaborative planning
- Review: Human review, refinement, and formal commit with PR creation

**Test-Driven Development Integration**:
- Test-First Approach: Define/generate tests collaboratively before implementation
- Dual AI Support: Claude for both test scaffolding and production code
- Enhanced Verification: TDD provides natural validation checkpoints
- Quality Assurance: Systematic verification through automated testing

**Repository Coordination Strategies**:
- Structured pull request templates
- Explicit AI interaction documentation
- Knowledge sharing protocols
