# Emotional Load Cognitive Architecture

## Core Concept

Modern cognitive load theory expands beyond the traditional triarchic model to include emotional load, where anxiety reduces working memory capacity by 12-18%, and environmental load from multimodal distractions increases extraneous load by 25%, requiring emotional and environmental factors in PKM system design.

## Research Context

Represents evolution of cognitive load theory to account for real-world factors affecting cognitive performance. Critical for designing PKM systems that operate effectively in emotionally and environmentally challenging knowledge work contexts.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Cognitive Science PKM Research 2024 (Cognitive Load Theory section)
- **Credibility Score**: 9
- **Validation Method**: Recent research expanding traditional cognitive load theory with empirical validation

## Connection Potential

Links to stress management, emotional regulation, attention research, working memory optimization, environmental design, and holistic cognitive performance frameworks.

## Implementation Notes

- Monitor and account for emotional state in cognitive load assessment
- Design calming, low-stress interfaces for knowledge work
- Minimize environmental distractions through focused interface design
- Provide emotional regulation support during intensive cognitive tasks
- Adapt cognitive demands based on user emotional state

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Extracted from expanded cognitive load theory research
- **Future**: Develop emotional load detection and mitigation strategies for PKM environments
