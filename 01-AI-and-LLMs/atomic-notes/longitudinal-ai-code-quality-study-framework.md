# Longitudinal AI Code Quality Study Framework

## Core Concept
Comprehensive 36-month longitudinal study methodology for analyzing AI-generated versus human-written code quality evolution using rigorous empirical investigation across 50+ production codebases with minimum 100k LOC each.

## Research Context
With 63% of developers using AI and AI contribution increasing from 5.7% in 2022 to 27.4% in 2024, understanding long-term quality implications requires systematic longitudinal analysis beyond snapshot comparisons.

## Core Quality Metrics
1. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: C = E - N + 2P measuring structural complexity
2. **Maintainability Index**: Microsoft formula with 0-100 scale thresholds
3. **Technical Debt Ratio**: TDR = Î”TCO/improvement_effort relationship
4. **Security Vulnerability Density**: V/S per 1000 LOC measurement
5. **Architectural Coherence Scores**: Modularity, coupling, cohesion analysis

## Methodological Framework
- **Baseline Establishment**: Comprehensive metric definition and threshold setting
- **Cohort Selection**: Industry-representative sample across fintech, healthcare, e-commerce
- **Tracking Infrastructure**: Automated monitoring through Git history and static analysis
- **Statistical Analysis**: Survival analysis and longitudinal pattern recognition

## Industry Sector Focus
- **Fintech**: Regulatory compliance and security vulnerability density
- **Healthcare**: Safety-critical systems with life-critical implications
- **E-commerce**: Scalability and performance optimization patterns
- **Gaming**: Real-time processing and performance requirements
- **Enterprise SaaS**: Subscription-based sustainability metrics
