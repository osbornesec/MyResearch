# MAPE-K Autonomous Self-Healing Architecture

## Core Concept
The Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute over shared Knowledge (MAPE-K) feedback loop serves as the foundational control model for autonomic self-adaptive systems, mirroring biological healing processes for software resilience.

## Research Context
Self-healing software architectures represent a paradigm shift from reactive to proactive system maintenance, drawing inspiration from biological systems to create intelligent maintenance capabilities.

## MAPE-K Components
1. **Monitor**: Sensory networks for continuous system observability and telemetry collection
2. **Analyze**: AI-powered cognitive processing for diagnosis and repair planning
3. **Plan**: Intelligent decision-making core for repair strategy development
4. **Execute**: Healing agents applying targeted code modifications and configuration adjustments
5. **Knowledge**: Adaptive memory systems retaining past issues and successful repairs

## Biological Inspiration Mapping
- **Sensory Networks**: System observability tools detecting software behavior anomalies
- **Cognitive Processing**: AI models functioning as decision-making core
- **Immune Response**: Healing agents applying targeted repairs
- **Adaptive Memory**: Learning systems retaining knowledge of repairs

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Autonomous Self-Healing Software Architectures Framework
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Cross-referenced with autonomic computing and biological systems research
