# AI Testing Tool and Technology Stack

## Core Concept
Comprehensive technology stack recommendations for AI testing, bias detection, security validation, production monitoring, and compliance management with tool comparison and integration guidance.

## Core Testing Tools
- **pytest/unittest**: AI model unit testing frameworks
- **Hypothesis**: Property-based testing for model invariants
- **Great Expectations**: Data pipeline validation and quality testing
- **Locust/JMeter**: Load and performance testing for AI services

## Bias Detection and Fairness
- **AI Fairness 360 (AIF360)**: IBM comprehensive fairness toolkit with extensive metrics
- **Fairlearn**: Microsoft fairness library with sklearn integration
- **Fairkit-learn**: Academic research-focused fairness toolkit
- **Custom implementations**: Domain-specific fairness validation

## Security Testing Stack
- **Bandit**: Python static security analysis and vulnerability detection
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanning for known CVEs
- **TruffleHog**: Git repository secret scanning and detection
- **SAST Tools**: Static application security testing integration

## Production Monitoring
- **Evidently AI**: ML-specific monitoring and drift detection (cloud/on-premise)
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Open-source metrics collection and visualization
- **Datadog**: Full-stack SaaS monitoring with AI/ML capabilities
- **DataRobot**: Enterprise end-to-end ML monitoring platform

## Compliance and Governance
- **OneTrust**: Privacy and compliance management (GDPR, CCPA focus)
- **ServiceNow GRC**: Enterprise governance, risk, and compliance platform
- **MLflow**: ML lifecycle management and model governance
- **DVC**: Data and model versioning for audit trails

## Integration and Orchestration
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD automation with extensive plugin ecosystem
- **GitLab CI**: Integrated repository and CI/CD platform
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration for production deployment
- **Argo Workflows**: ML pipeline orchestration and workflow management

## Selection Criteria
- **Integration Level**: Core vs. supplementary tooling requirements
- **Deployment Model**: Cloud, on-premise, or hybrid deployment options
- **Compliance Focus**: Industry-specific regulatory requirement alignment
- **Scalability**: Enterprise-grade performance and scaling capabilities
