# ExKG-LLM Knowledge Graph Framework

## Core Concept

The ExKG-LLM framework leverages GPT-4 to construct cognitive neuroscience knowledge graphs from unstructured literature, mapping relationships between neural regions, cognitive functions, and disorders with explicit linking of concepts to specific brain regions validated via meta-analytic fMRI data.

## Research Context

Demonstrates how large language models can systematically extract and structure knowledge from unstructured sources into semantically rich knowledge graphs, providing a model for automated PKM knowledge extraction and organization.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Cognitive Science PKM Research 2024 (Knowledge Graphs section)
- **Credibility Score**: 9
- **Validation Method**: Validated through meta-analytic fMRI data with explicit neural region mapping

## Connection Potential

Links to automated knowledge extraction, semantic networks, LLM applications, graph neural networks, literature synthesis, and structured knowledge representation.

## Implementation Notes

- Use LLMs for extracting structured knowledge from unstructured sources
- Create explicit mappings between concepts and supporting evidence
- Validate extracted relationships through multiple sources
- Build semantic networks that preserve evidential relationships
- Enable traversal from high-level concepts to specific supporting research

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Extracted from cognitive science research on knowledge graph construction
- **Future**: Adapt ExKG-LLM principles for general-purpose PKM knowledge extraction and graph construction
