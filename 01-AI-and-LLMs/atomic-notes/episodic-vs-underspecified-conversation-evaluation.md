# Episodic vs Underspecified Conversation Evaluation

## Core Concept

Episodic conversation evaluation treats each turn as a decomposable subtask that can be evaluated in isolation, while underspecified conversation evaluation requires active information fusion across turns to address incomplete user instructions. Research shows episodic tasks significantly overestimate LLM performance in realistic conversational settings, as they avoid the core challenge of handling uncertainty and incomplete information.

## Research Context

This distinction reveals a critical gap in current LLM evaluation methodologies. Most existing multi-turn benchmarks (like MT-bench) use episodic frameworks where each turn introduces related but independent subtasks. Real-world conversations involve underspecification where users gradually reveal requirements, creating fundamentally different cognitive demands that current evaluation approaches fail to capture.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: "LLMs Get Lost In Multi-Turn Conversation" - Section 2 Background and Related Work
- **Credibility Score**: 9
- **Validation Method**: Comparative analysis of evaluation frameworks and conversation log analysis from real-world usage

## Connection Potential

Links to evaluation framework design, benchmarking methodologies, user experience research, and conversational AI assessment. Connects to existing concepts around AI system validation, performance measurement, and real-world deployment considerations.

## Implementation Notes

Episodic tasks maintain the illusion of multi-turn capability while avoiding the core challenges of underspecification. True conversational evaluation requires tasks where: (1) solution cannot be decomposed turn-by-turn, (2) revealing new information modifies the entire solution approach, and (3) early assumptions significantly impact final outcomes.
