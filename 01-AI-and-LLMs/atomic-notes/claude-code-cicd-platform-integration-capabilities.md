## Core Concept

Claude Code integrates with major CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps) through YAML-based workflows and API calls, enabling automated build processes, quality gate enforcement, and AI-assisted code generation within continuous delivery pipelines.

## Research Context

Essential for DevOps teams implementing AI-assisted development workflows. Enables systematic integration of AI coding assistance into existing CI/CD infrastructure.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Platform documentation and integration examples
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10
- **Validation Method**: Verified through current CI/CD platform capabilities research

## Implementation Notes

**Platform-Specific Integration Approaches**:

**GitHub Actions**:
- YAML-based workflows in `.github/workflows`
- Custom actions for AI-assisted code generation
- Native GitHub integration with PR automation
- Zero-config setup for GitHub repositories

**Jenkins**:
- Groovy-based pipeline scripts (`Jenkinsfile`)
- Plugin ecosystem for AI integration
- Highly customizable for enterprise requirements
- Self-hosted flexibility but requires manual setup

**GitLab CI**:
- Single `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuration file
- Unified DevOps suite integration
- Built-in security scanning with AI validation
- Container-based pipeline execution

**Integration Capabilities**:
- Automated build and test cycle triggers
- Quality gate enforcement with AI assistance
- Multi-stage deployment workflows
- Version control event-driven triggers
