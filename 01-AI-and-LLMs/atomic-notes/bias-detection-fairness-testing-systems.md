# Bias Detection and Fairness Testing Systems

## Core Concept
Systematic framework for detecting, measuring, and mitigating bias in AI models through statistical fairness metrics, continuous monitoring, and automated mitigation strategies.

## Fairness Metrics Implementation
- **Statistical Parity**: Equal positive prediction rates across protected groups
- **Equalized Odds**: Equal true positive and false positive rates by group
- **Intersectional Bias Detection**: Analysis across multiple protected attribute combinations
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time bias tracking in production

## Key Testing Components
- Protected attribute analysis (race, gender, age)
- Automated bias threshold checking
- Multi-dimensional fairness assessment
- Bias mitigation pipeline integration

## Mitigation Strategies
- **Pre-processing**: Data reweighing and disparate impact removal
- **In-processing**: Fair algorithm training constraints
- **Post-processing**: Output adjustment for fairness
- **Validation**: Effectiveness measurement of mitigation

## Technical Implementation
- AIF360 toolkit for comprehensive fairness metrics
- Custom fairness testing suites with threshold validation
- Automated alerting for bias threshold violations
- Integration with model training and deployment pipelines

## Compliance Integration
- GDPR non-discrimination requirements
- Equal opportunity employment standards
- Financial services fair lending regulations
- Healthcare equity mandates
