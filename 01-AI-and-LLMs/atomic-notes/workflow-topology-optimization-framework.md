## Core Concept

Workflow topology optimization is the second stage of MASS framework that focuses on determining the most effective arrangement and connectivity between agents by searching within a pruned space of influential topologies.

## Optimization Methodology

### Influence-Based Pruning
- Measure incremental influence: Iₐᵢ = E(a*ᵢ) / E(a*₀)
- Calculate selection probability: pₐ = Softmax(Iₐ, t) where t controls sharpening
- Activate topology dimension only if u > pₐ (where u ~ U(0,1))
- Focus search on topologies that demonstrate positive performance impact

### Search Space Design
- Use predefined rule-based order to reduce complexity: [summarize, reflect, debate, aggregate]
- Apply rejection sampling over constrained design space
- Reject deactivated dimensions and invalid compositions exceeding budget B
- Maintain maximum agent budget (e.g., 10 agents) for fair comparison

### Configuration Discovery
- Search multiple topology configurations via rejection sampling (e.g., 10 different topologies)
- Evaluate each topology on validation set multiple times for stability (e.g., 3 evaluations)
- Select best-performing topology configuration for final stage optimization

## Why This Matters

Traditional topology optimization suffers from exponential search complexity and includes many ineffective configurations. This framework addresses the insight that beneficial topologies represent only a small fraction of the full design space, making focused search more efficient and effective.

## Performance Evidence

- Achieves 3% average performance gain over block-level optimization alone
- Demonstrates that only small fraction of topologies provide benefits (e.g., in HotpotQA, only debate brings 3% gain)
- Reduces search complexity while maintaining effectiveness through influence-based pruning
- Enables discovery of optimal configurations like aggregate-based architectures outperforming debate

## Search Space Components

### Topology Building Blocks
- **Aggregate**: Parallel agents with diversified predictions + aggregation operator
- **Reflect**: Agents as verifiers providing iterative improvement feedback
- **Debate**: Multi-round discussion with opinion collection and response updates
- **Custom**: Task-specific agents (e.g., summarize for long-context capability)
- **Tool-use**: Binary decision for external tool integration

### Parameterization Options
- **Aggregate**: Na agents acting in parallel
- **Reflect**: Nr rounds for self-reflection
- **Debate**: Nd rounds for debating
- **Custom**: Task-specific parameter configurations
- **Tool-use**: NT ∈ {0, 1} for tool integration

## Implementation Guidelines

### Budget Constraints
- Maximum number of agents per configuration (typically 10)
- Computational budget for evaluation rounds per topology
- Time constraints for rejection sampling iterations

### Evaluation Protocol
- Multiple validation runs per topology for stability
- Performance measurement on held-out validation set
- Consistent evaluation metrics across topology types

### Search Efficiency
- Probability-based activation reduces invalid configurations
- Rule-based ordering prevents combinatorial explosion
- Rejection sampling handles constraint satisfaction efficiently
