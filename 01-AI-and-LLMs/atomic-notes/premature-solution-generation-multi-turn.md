# Premature Solution Generation in Multi-Turn Dialogue

## Core Concept

LLMs frequently generate premature "answer attempts" in early conversation turns before receiving complete specification, making incorrect assumptions about missing requirements. This leads to overly verbose responses and creates confusion when later turns provide clarifying information that contradicts early assumptions.

## Research Context

This behavior is identified as a primary root cause of performance degradation in multi-turn conversations. Models struggle to distinguish between user-provided requirements and their own assumption-based previous responses, leading to cascading errors throughout the conversation. Reasoning models show this pattern more severely due to generating 33% longer responses on average.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: "LLMs Get Lost In Multi-Turn Conversation" - Section 6.2 and Appendix F.1
- **Credibility Score**: 9
- **Validation Method**: Behavioral analysis across simulated conversations with response strategy classification

## Connection Potential

Links to conversation design patterns, user interface design for AI systems, prompt engineering strategies, and conversational AI architecture. Connects to existing concepts around AI planning methodologies and uncertainty handling in AI systems.

## Implementation Notes

Answer attempts are classified through response strategy categorization: clarification, refusal, hedging, interrogation, discussion, missing, or answer attempt. Models showing premature answer attempts demonstrate poor recovery when subsequent clarifying information is provided, indicating fundamental issues with conversation state management.
