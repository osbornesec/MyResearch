# MCP Shared State Coordination via Supabase Patterns

## Core Concept

Supabase MCP serves as the central coordination database for swarm intelligence, enabling shared state management through agent coordination tables tracking session state, current tasks, results, and dependencies, plus task distribution tables managing workflow assignment, status tracking, and priority coordination across multiple specialized agents.

## Research Context

This provides the critical workaround for MCP's lack of direct inter-agent communication, establishing how database-mediated coordination can enable swarm-like behaviors within current protocol constraints while maintaining consistency and enabling fault tolerance.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: MCP Swarm Intelligence Orchestration Analysis 2025, Section 3.1.2
- **Credibility Score**: 8
- **Validation Method**: Database schema design validated against coordination requirements

## Connection Potential

- Links to distributed state management and database coordination patterns
- Connects to event-driven coordination and task distribution systems
- Relates to fault tolerance and error propagation in multi-agent systems
- Foundation for real-time synchronization and conflict resolution mechanisms

## Implementation Notes

Key database structures include agent_coordination table (id, session_id, agent_role, status, current_task JSONB, results JSONB, dependencies, timestamps) and task_distribution table (workflow_id, assigned_agent, task_definition JSONB, status, priority, execution timestamps). Enables asynchronous coordination and persistent state across agent interactions.

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Created from Smart Extraction of shared state coordination patterns
- **Future**: Needs connection to real-time synchronization mechanisms and conflict resolution protocols
