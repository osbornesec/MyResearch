# ReAct Reasoning Action Loop

## Core Concept
ReAct is a paradigm that combines reasoning and acting with LLMs through an interleaved thought-action-observation loop. The model generates reasoning traces to induce, track, and update action plans while interfacing with external sources for information gathering, creating dynamic iterative refinement based on new information.

## Research Context
ReAct represents a dynamic form of iteration where models can decide to gather more information based on intermediate reasoning steps, refining approaches as new information becomes available. This creates a feedback loop between reasoning and information gathering that mirrors human problem-solving approaches.
