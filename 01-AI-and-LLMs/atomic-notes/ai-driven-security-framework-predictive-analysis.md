# AI-Driven Predictive Security Framework

## Core Concept
AI-driven security transforms reactive cybersecurity into proactive intelligence using machine learning for vulnerability forecasting, achieving 98% accuracy in vulnerability classification and 84% reduction in mean time to detection.

## Research Context
The cybersecurity landscape shifts from reactive defense to proactive AI-driven systems that predict, prevent, and automatically respond to threats before materialization, integrating throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Machine Learning Architecture
1. **Supervised Learning**: Known vulnerability pattern recognition using CVE, CWE, OWASP databases
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Anomaly detection for unknown threat patterns
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Adaptive security policy optimization based on threat evolution

## Performance Metrics
- **Detection Accuracy**: 98% accuracy with 95-98% F1-scores in vulnerability classification
- **Threat Prediction**: 85% accuracy predicting attack vectors from millions of daily logs
- **Response Time**: 84% reduction in mean time to detection (MTTD)
- **False Positive Reduction**: Up to 42% improvement over traditional tools

## Technical Components
- **Neural Networks**: CNNs for feature extraction, LSTMs for temporal analysis
- **FastEmbed Integration**: 33.577% improvement in exploit prediction on imbalanced datasets
- **Threat Intelligence**: Real-time MITRE ATT&CK framework integration
- **Knowledge Graphs**: CVE-CWE-CPE association prediction for hidden vulnerabilities
