## Core Concept

Model quantization reduces numerical precision of model weights and activations from 32-bit floating point to lower-bit representations (INT8, INT4), achieving 2-6x inference speedup with minimal accuracy degradation (<1-2% loss) while reducing memory footprint by 75-87.5%.

## Research Context

Essential technique for deploying large language models in production environments where computational resources and latency requirements are critical constraints. Forms foundation of modern AI optimization pipelines.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: [[AI-Performance-Optimization-Research-2025]] - Dr. Chen Wei research report
- **Credibility Score**: 8
- **Validation Method**: Industry benchmark results and production deployment data

## Quantization Techniques

### Dynamic Quantization
- **Performance**: 1.5-2x speedup without retraining
- **Implementation**: Runtime conversion during inference
- **Best For**: Models where retraining is not feasible

### Static INT8 Quantization  
- **Performance**: 2-4x speedup with <1% accuracy loss
- **Memory Reduction**: 75% reduction in model size
- **Requirements**: Calibration dataset for optimal quantization parameters

### Aggressive INT4 Quantization
- **Performance**: 2.5-6x speedup with <2% accuracy loss for LLMs
- **Memory Reduction**: 87.5% reduction in model size
- **Trade-offs**: Higher accuracy degradation for smaller models

## Production Implementation Pattern

```python
# PyTorch Dynamic Quantization Pipeline
import torch
from torch.quantization import quantize_dynamic

def optimize_model_quantization(model_fp32):
    # Dynamic quantization for immediate deployment
    model_int8 = quantize_dynamic(
        model_fp32, {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8
    )
    return model_int8
```
