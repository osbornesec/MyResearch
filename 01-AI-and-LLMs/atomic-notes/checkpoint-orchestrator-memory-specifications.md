# CheckPoint Maestro Orchestrator Memory Specifications

## Core Concept
CheckPoint Maestro orchestrators provide gateway clustering with specific memory architectures: MHO-140 offers 16GB DDR3 RAM with 1.28 Tbps fabric capacity, while MHO-175 provides 32GB DDR4 RAM with 3.2 Tbps fabric capacity for hyperscale deployments.

## Technical Specifications
- **MHO-140 Orchestrator**: 16GB DDR3 RAM, 120GB SSD storage, 48×SFP28 (10GbE) ports, 1.28 Tbps fabric capacity
- **MHO-175 Orchestrator**: 32GB DDR4 RAM, 120GB SSD storage, 32×QSFP28 (100GbE) ports, 3.2 Tbps fabric capacity
- **Memory Utilization**: Each managed gateway consumes ~2GB RAM for state synchronization
- **Virtual System Support**: MHO-175 supports ≤250 virtual systems across clustered gateways

## Performance Characteristics
- **Latency**: 300-425 nsec port-to-port fabric latency using DAC cabling
- **Buffer Requirements**: 4MB buffer per 10K connections for fabric management
- **Failover Impact**: Memory-reserved session tables required for redundant power supply operations
- **Clustering Overhead**: Orchestrating three 26000 gateways demands >75% of MHO-175 packet buffer capacity

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: CheckPoint Maestro hardware datasheets and orchestrator specifications
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10 (CheckPoint official documentation)
- **Validation Method**: Cross-referenced through multiple official hardware specification documents

## Connection Potential
Essential for understanding distributed system orchestration, memory requirements in cluster management, and hyperscale infrastructure planning for enterprise security architectures.
