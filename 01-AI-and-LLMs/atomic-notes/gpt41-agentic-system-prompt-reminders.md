# GPT-4.1 Agentic System Prompt Reminders

## Core Concept
Three essential system prompt components for GPT-4.1 agentic workflows: Persistence (ensures multi-message turn understanding), Tool-calling (encourages full tool utilization over hallucination), and Planning (explicit reasoning between tool calls). These three instructions increased SWE-bench Verified scores by close to 20%.

## Technical Implementation
```
1. Persistence: "You are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved."

2. Tool-calling: "If you are not sure about file content or codebase structure pertaining to the user's request, use your tools to read files and gather the relevant information: do NOT guess or make up an answer."

3. Planning: "You MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls. DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully."
```

## Performance Impact
- **20% SWE-bench Improvement**: These three instructions transform model from chatbot-like to eager agent behavior
- **Agent State Transformation**: Changes model from reactive to proactive autonomous interaction driving
- **Tool Utilization**: 2% increase in pass rate using API-parsed tools vs manual injection

## Research Context
Critical for developing effective agentic AI systems that maintain task persistence and utilize available tools optimally.
