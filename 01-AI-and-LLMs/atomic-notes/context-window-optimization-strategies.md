# Context Window Optimization Strategies

## Core Concept
Dynamic context selection methodology that improves code relevance by up to 40% while reducing token consumption through relevance-based file selection and hierarchical context organization.

## Why This Matters
Large codebases require intelligent context selection to provide relevant information within token limits, enabling better AI assistance without overwhelming the model with irrelevant code.

## Implementation Guidance
- Calculate relevance scores based on semantic similarity and import relationships
- Organize context hierarchically: immediate (1.0 weight), related (0.8), dependencies (0.6), architectural (0.4)
- Select files dynamically within token budget using relevance ranking
- Include recent modifications and code complexity in scoring algorithm
- Format context with clear file boundaries and language identifiers

## Connections
- [[Few-Shot Prompting Effectiveness]] - Example selection within context
- [[Multi-File Project Context Management]] - Large project handling
- [[Template-Based Prompting Consistency]] - Structured context presentation
