# Traditional AI Planning Methodologies

## Core Concept
Classical AI planning approaches for software development including LLM-based planning, hierarchical task networks (HTN), and specialized planning systems with formal knowledge representation.

## LLM-Based Planning Systems
- **GPT-4 & Claude**: Natural language task decomposition with contextual understanding
- **GitHub Copilot Workspace**: Integrated development environment planning
- **Microsoft Project Cortex**: Enterprise project intelligence platform
- **Performance**: 12-30% success for autonomous planning, 85-92% for guided decomposition

## Classical Planning Foundations
- **STRIPS**: Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver for state-space planning
- **HTN (Hierarchical Task Networks)**: Decomposition-based planning approach
- **PDDL**: Planning Domain Definition Language for standardized representation
- **Performance**: 60-82% success rates in structured domains

## Knowledge Representation
- **Software Development Ontologies**: Formal task, feature, bug, and epic representation
- **Constraint Modeling**: Resource constraints, dependencies, deadlines
- **OWL/RDF**: Semantic representation for planning domains

## Learning and Adaptation
- **Historical Performance Analysis**: Effort estimation learning from past projects
- **Adaptive Planning**: Dynamic replanning based on progress monitoring
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Random forest models for effort estimation
- **Deviation Detection**: Real-time plan adjustment mechanisms

## Technical Implementation
- Planning algorithm complexity: PSPACE-complete (STRIPS), Undecidable (HTN)
- Cost: $0.01-0.10 per planning session for LLM approaches
- Speed: 10-30 seconds for medium complexity projects
- Scalability limitations based on domain complexity
