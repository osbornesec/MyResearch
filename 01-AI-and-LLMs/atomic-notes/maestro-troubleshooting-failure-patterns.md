# Maestro Troubleshooting Failure Patterns

## Core Concept
CheckPoint Maestro experiences three primary failure categories: SGM communication issues (40%), unresponsive SGMs (25%), and version mismatches (30%), with JHF inconsistencies accounting for 73% of version-related incidents.

## Common Failure Distribution
- **SGM Communication Failures**: 40% of incidents (VLAN, MTU, STP issues)
- **Unresponsive SGMs**: 25% of incidents (kernel panics, memory leaks)
- **Version Mismatches**: 30% of incidents (JHF inconsistencies primary cause)
- **Other Issues**: 5% (hardware failures, configuration errors)

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Network Infrastructure**: Layer 2 issues, spanning tree conflicts, MTU mismatches
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory leaks, CPU overload, disk space constraints
- **Software Consistency**: Jumbo Hotfix (JHF) version disparities across SGMs
- **Hardware Failures**: Less common but require complete SGM replacement workflow

## Diagnostic Command Arsenal
- **Communication**: `asg monitor`, `cphaprob stat`, network connectivity tests
- **Performance**: `asg perf`, `asg resource`, system resource monitoring
- **Version Validation**: `cpinfo -y all`, JHF consistency checks
- **Log Analysis**: `asg log`, centralized logging for correlation

## Resolution Patterns
- **Systematic Approach**: Start with network layer, progress to application layer
- **Rolling Procedures**: Group-based updates to maintain service availability
- **Complete Replacement**: When SGM becomes unresponsive or corrupted
