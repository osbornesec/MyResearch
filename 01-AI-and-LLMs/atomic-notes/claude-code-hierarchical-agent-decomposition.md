# Claude Code Hierarchical Agent Decomposition

## Core Concept

Claude Code's AgentTool implements hierarchical task decomposition by spawning sub-agents for complex tasks and synthesizing their findings, enabling sophisticated problem-solving that exceeds single-agent capabilities.

## Hierarchical Architecture

**Task Decomposition Process**:
- Complex tasks are broken into subtasks appropriate for individual agents
- Sub-agents are spawned with specific, focused objectives
- Each sub-agent operates with dedicated context and tools
- Results are synthesized back into the main agent's understanding
- Hierarchical coordination manages resource allocation and task dependencies

## Research Context

This architecture enables Claude Code to handle complex development tasks that require multiple perspectives or specialized analysis. Rather than attempting monolithic problem-solving, the system leverages specialized sub-agents that can focus on specific aspects while maintaining overall coordination.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Southbridge Research cleanroom analysis
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10 (architectural pattern analysis)
- **Validation Method**: Multi-agent coordination patterns verified

## Connection Potential

Links to: multi-agent systems, task decomposition strategies, hierarchical problem solving, AI orchestration patterns, distributed intelligence

## Key Insight

Hierarchical agent decomposition represents a fundamental advancement in AI coding tools, enabling complex problem-solving through coordinated specialization rather than attempting to solve all problems with a single generalist agent.
