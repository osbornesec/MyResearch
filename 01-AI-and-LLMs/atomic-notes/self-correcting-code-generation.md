## Core Concept

Self-correcting code generation systems use meta-prompting and iterative self-reflection to autonomously improve code quality through multiple correction cycles, achieving 15-25% accuracy improvements with 60% token efficiency gains.

## Content

### Mechanism
- **Iterative reflection**: AI analyzes its own code outputs for correctness, quality, and edge case handling
- **Meta-cognitive prompting**: Higher-level prompts that ask AI to evaluate its own reasoning and capabilities
- **Automated correction cycles**: System generates code, analyzes it, identifies issues, and iterates improvements
- **Performance tracking**: Metrics on improvement across iterations with convergence detection

### Key Benefits
- **15-25% accuracy improvement** in complex algorithmic tasks
- **60% token efficiency gains** through targeted corrections
- **30-40% reduction** in debugging iterations
- **50% improvement** in edge case handling

### Implementation Architecture
```python
class SelfCorrectingCodeGenerator:
    def generate_with_self_correction(self, prompt, max_iterations=3):
        # 1. Initial generation
        # 2. Reflection analysis (correctness, quality, edge cases)
        # 3. Improvement identification and prioritization
        # 4. Iterative refinement until satisfactory or max iterations
```

### Critical Success Factors
- **Quality reflection prompts**: Structured analysis of correctness, readability, performance, security
- **Convergence criteria**: Clear metrics for when to stop iterating
- **Error pattern recognition**: Learning from common mistake patterns
- **Context preservation**: Maintaining original requirements across iterations
