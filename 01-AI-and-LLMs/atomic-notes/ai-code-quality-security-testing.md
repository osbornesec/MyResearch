# AI Code Quality and Security Testing

## Core Concept
Specialized security and quality validation framework for AI-generated code and AI systems, including vulnerability detection, prompt injection resistance, and semantic correctness validation.

## AI Code Validation Components
- **Static Analysis**: Pylint, Bandit security scanning
- **Semantic Correctness**: AST parsing and behavior validation
- **Security Patterns**: SQL injection, command injection detection
- **AI-Specific Checks**: Error handling, input validation, naming conventions

## Security Testing Framework
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Pattern-based detection of security flaws
- **Prompt Injection Testing**: Resistance to adversarial inputs
- **Hardcoded Secret Detection**: API keys, passwords in code
- **Output Safety Validation**: XSS, code injection prevention

## Performance Benchmarking
- **Function Performance**: Execution time, memory usage tracking
- **CPU Usage Monitoring**: Resource consumption analysis
- **Success Rate Metrics**: Reliability under load
- **Threshold Validation**: Performance SLA compliance

## Quality Assurance Standards
- Proper error handling implementation
- Input validation requirements
- Documentation and commenting standards
- Code complexity and maintainability metrics

## Integration Patterns
- CI/CD pipeline integration for automated scanning
- Real-time security monitoring in development
- Quality gate enforcement before deployment
- Continuous security validation in production

## Tool Stack
- **Bandit**: Python security linting
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Pylint**: Code quality analysis
- **Custom validators**: AI-specific pattern detection
