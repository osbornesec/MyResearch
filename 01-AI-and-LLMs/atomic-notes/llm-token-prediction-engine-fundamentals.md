# LLM Token Prediction Engine Fundamentals

## Core Concept
Large Language Models function as sophisticated next-token prediction systems, calculating what is most likely to come next based on patterns learned during training. This prediction mechanism forms the foundation upon which all prompt engineering techniques are built.

## Research Context
Understanding LLMs as prediction engines is essential for effective prompt engineering, as it explains why specific prompting techniques work and how to craft inputs that guide the model toward desired predictions.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: "Prompt Engineering: A Comprehensive Guide to Iterative Refinement for Large Language Models" citing Georgetown CSET research
- **Secondary Source**: "Recursive Learning Prompt Engineering Best Practices"
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Referenced from established academic research on LLM architecture

## Connection Potential
- Fundamental to all prompt engineering techniques
- Links to sampling parameter optimization (temperature, top-k, top-p)
- Connects to Chain of Thought reasoning mechanisms
- Relates to context window management strategies
