# AI Model Automated Testing Framework

## Core Concept
Comprehensive automated testing framework for AI models that includes unit testing, integration testing, and CI/CD pipeline integration to ensure model reliability and consistency.

## Key Components
- **Unit Testing**: Input validation, output consistency, and model logic testing
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end data pipeline and service integration testing
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing in development pipelines
- **Quality Gates**: Pre-deployment validation checkpoints

## Testing Patterns
- Property-based testing with Hypothesis for model invariants
- Reproducibility testing for consistent outputs
- Performance integration testing under load
- Shadow deployment and A/B testing frameworks

## Implementation Tools
- **pytest/unittest**: Core testing frameworks
- **Hypothesis**: Property-based testing
- **Great Expectations**: Data pipeline validation
- **GitHub Actions/Jenkins**: CI/CD integration

## Quality Validation Requirements
- Minimum accuracy thresholds (e.g., 95%)
- Performance benchmarks for latency/throughput
- Security scan pass requirements
- Data quality validation standards
