# CheckPoint Identity Mapping Performance and Scalability Boundaries

## Core Concept
CheckPoint Maestro identity mapping performance scales to **1,900 login events per second per PDP** with linear degradation beyond 35 AD servers, requiring PDP redundancy at >10 gateways and specialized tuning for hyperscale deployments.

## Technical Details
- **PDP Scalability Limit**: One PDP per 1,900 logins/second with 35 AD server maximum
- **Session Throughput**: 35 AD logon servers per PDP before LDAP query latency increases nonlinearly
- **Failover Performance**: PDP redundancy enables session retrieval from backup PDPs within 6 seconds
- **HyperSync Overhead**: 1.2% throughput loss per gateway module limits linear scaling
- **Tuning Parameters**: adlogconfig interval, MUH thresholds, chunk size optimization (100â†’500 users)
- **Recommended Architecture**: Dedicated PDP gateways in >5-node clusters to avoid PEP resource contention

## Research Context
These performance boundaries determine identity architecture design for large enterprises, particularly in environments exceeding 50,000 users requiring hybrid deployment strategies.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Sources**: CheckPoint performance documentation, community best practices
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10
- **Validation Method**: Performance metrics cross-referenced with deployment recommendations
