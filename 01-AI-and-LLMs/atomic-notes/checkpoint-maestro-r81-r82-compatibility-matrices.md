# CheckPoint Maestro R81 R82 Compatibility Matrices

## Core Concept
CheckPoint enforces strict compatibility matrices for R81 to R82 migrations, requiring specific Jumbo Hotfix Accumulator versions and following prescribed upgrade paths to ensure successful version transitions in Maestro environments.

## Version-Specific Requirements
### R81.20 to R82 Direct Upgrade
- **Minimum Requirement**: Take 92+ of R81.20 Jumbo Hotfix Accumulator
- **Management Server**: Must support R82 per sk113113 compatibility matrix
- **Upgrade Path**: Direct migration supported after hotfix installation
- **Validation**: Pre-Upgrade Verifier confirms readiness before transition

### R81.10 to R82 Migration
- **Minimum Requirement**: Take 172+ of R81.10 Jumbo Hotfix Accumulator
- **Upgrade Path**: Direct migration supported with proper hotfix version
- **Dependencies**: HyperSync synchronization defects resolved in Take 172+
- **Management Compatibility**: R82 management server required for administration

### Legacy Version Upgrades
- **R80.30SP/R80.20SP**: Requires three-stage upgrade path
  1. Stage 1: Upgrade to intermediate R81.20
  2. Stage 2: Apply R81.20 Jumbo Take 92+
  3. Stage 3: Execute R81.20 to R82 migration
- **Schema Compatibility**: Mitigates management database incompatibilities
- **VSX Dependencies**: Requires explicit version declaration via `vsx_util` commands

## Hardware Compatibility
- **Orchestrator 140-series**: Supports R81.20/R82 features including ElasticXL
- **Legacy Orchestrators**: Earlier models require hardware refresh for R82 capabilities
- **VSX Virtual Environments**: LACP bond mode limitations during MVC upgrades
- **CloudGuard Integration**: R82 exclusively supports API v1.8 for automation workflows

## Management Server Dependencies
- **Backward Compatibility**: Limited to N-2 versions per sk113113
- **Administration Requirement**: R82 management server mandatory for R82 security group administration
- **API Compatibility**: Version alignment required for CloudGuard integrations
- **Database Schema**: Management database updates required for R82 object support

## Critical Limitations
- **MVC Window**: Cluster members must homogenize versions within 72 hours
- **LACP Bond Interfaces**: Trigger PMTR-88191 defect during R81â†’R81.20 transitions
- **Jumbo Dependencies**: Omitting required Takes causes HyperSync failures during R82 migration
- **Rollback Constraints**: Version downgrades limited to 4-hour retention windows

## Validation Procedures
- **Pre-Upgrade Verifier**: Validates upgrade readiness including hotfix requirements
- **Compatibility Check**: Confirms management server and orchestrator version alignment
- **Dependency Verification**: Ensures all required hotfixes and updates are installed
- **Risk Assessment**: Generates compatibility reports for change approval processes

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: CheckPoint sk113113, R82 Scalable Platforms Guide, Jumbo Hotfix documentation
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Multi-source verification from official CheckPoint compatibility documentation
