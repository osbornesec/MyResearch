# Tree-of-Thought Practical Prompt Templates

## Core Concept
Tree-of-Thought prompt templates provide standardized four-phase structures for different coding domains: Algorithm Design (approach generation → evaluation matrix → detailed expansion → final recommendation), Debugging Analysis (hypothesis tree generation → hypothesis evaluation → investigation strategy → resolution path), Code Refactoring (strategy exploration → impact analysis → refactoring plan → implementation), and API Design (architectural approach exploration → decision matrix → detailed specification → implementation plan). Each template enforces systematic exploration while maintaining domain-specific optimization patterns.

## Research Context
Structured prompt templates are essential for reproducible ToT implementation in production environments. Research shows that standardized templates reduce cognitive load for developers while ensuring comprehensive coverage of solution space exploration. Templates serve as cognitive scaffolding that guides AI reasoning through complex problem domains.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Tree-of-Thought Complete Guide
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Comprehensive literature review and practical validation

## Implementation Details

### Algorithm Design Template Structure
**Phase 1**: Generate 3-4 fundamentally different algorithmic approaches with complexity analysis
**Phase 2**: Evaluation matrix scoring (correctness, performance, implementation difficulty, maintenance, scalability)
**Phase 3**: Detailed expansion of top 2 approaches (implementation steps, edge cases, testing strategy)
**Phase 4**: Final recommendation with justification and step-by-step implementation plan

### Debugging Analysis Template Framework
**Phase 1**: Hypothesis tree generation organized by system layers (application, database, network, infrastructure)
**Phase 2**: Hypothesis evaluation (likelihood 1-10, impact 1-10, investigation effort 1-10)
**Phase 3**: Prioritized investigation strategy with diagnostic steps and timeline
**Phase 4**: Resolution path (confirmed cause, immediate fix, permanent solution, prevention strategy)

### Code Refactoring Template Pattern
**Phase 1**: Strategy exploration across three dimensions (structural improvements, performance optimizations, maintainability enhancements)
**Phase 2**: Impact analysis (quality improvement, performance impact, implementation risk, time investment)
**Phase 3**: Refactoring plan with prioritized strategies and implementation sequence
**Phase 4**: Implementation with before/after code examples and change quantification

### API Design Template Architecture
**Phase 1**: Architectural approach exploration (REST, GraphQL, gRPC) with trade-off analysis
**Phase 2**: Decision matrix evaluation (performance, developer experience, scalability, maintenance, compatibility)
**Phase 3**: Detailed specification (endpoints, authentication, rate limiting, versioning, documentation)
**Phase 4**: Implementation plan with testing strategy across multiple dimensions
