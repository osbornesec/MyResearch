# Self-Consistency Multiple Reasoning Paths

## Core Concept
Self-Consistency Prompting enhances LLM reasoning capabilities by generating multiple outputs with the same CoT prompt and selecting the most consistent answer through majority voting. This technique represents an explicit form of iterative refinement through parallel exploration and consensus.

## Research Context
Self-consistency is particularly effective for mathematical problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic reasoning tasks. It essentially applies ensemble learning principles to prompt engineering by exploring diverse reasoning paths.
