# Constraint Satisfaction in Planning Systems

## Core Concept

Advanced constraint satisfaction techniques integrated into AI planning systems to manage temporal dependencies, resource limitations, and logical constraints, enabling practical software development planning through efficient constraint propagation and solution space pruning.

## HTN-CSP Hybrid Architecture

### Constraint Integration Framework
Modern HTN systems integrate constraint satisfaction for comprehensive planning:
- **Temporal Constraints**: Start/end time windows for task execution and dependencies
- **Resource Constraints**: Equipment availability, team capacity, and skill requirements
- **Precedence Constraints**: Task ordering dependencies and milestone sequences
- **Quality Constraints**: Testing requirements, code review standards, compliance needs

### Implementation Strategy
**Constraint Propagation during Task Decomposition**: Ensures feasible plans by validating constraints at each decomposition level, preventing invalid planning paths early in the search process.

## Markov Decision Process Constraint Integration

### Sequential Decision Framework
Model software project planning under uncertainty with constraints:
- **States**: Project configurations (progress, resources, risks, quality metrics)
- **Actions**: Planning decisions (resource allocation, task prioritization, schedule adjustments)
- **Transitions**: Outcome probabilities constrained by resource and temporal limits
- **Rewards**: Project success metrics validated against constraint satisfaction

### Constraint Types in Software Planning
```yaml
Temporal Constraints:
  - deadline_constraints: "task completion before project milestones"
  - dependency_constraints: "task B cannot start until task A completes"
  - resource_availability: "developer only available during specified periods"

Resource Constraints:  
  - skill_matching: "task requires specific technical competencies"
  - capacity_limits: "team cannot exceed concurrent task threshold"
  - budget_constraints: "total cost must remain within allocated limits"

Quality Constraints:
  - testing_requirements: "minimum coverage and validation standards"
  - review_obligations: "code review before integration"
  - compliance_standards: "security and regulatory requirements"
```

## Probabilistic Constraint Satisfaction

### Bayesian Network Constraint Modeling
Integrate uncertainty with logical constraints:
- **Nodes**: Project variables (effort estimates, risk factors, quality scores)
- **Edges**: Causal dependencies constrained by logical relationships
- **CPTs**: Conditional probability tables respecting constraint boundaries
- **Inference**: Probabilistic reasoning within constraint-satisfying solution space

### Uncertainty Quantification
Model planning constraints with confidence intervals:
- **Effort Estimation**: Range constraints with probability distributions
- **Resource Availability**: Stochastic capacity modeling with constraint bounds
- **Risk Assessment**: Probabilistic constraint violation analysis

## Advanced Constraint Techniques

### Constraint Propagation Algorithms
- **Arc Consistency**: Ensure binary constraint satisfaction across planning variables
- **Forward Checking**: Eliminate inconsistent values during search progression
- **Constraint Learning**: Acquire new constraints from failed search attempts
- **Backjumping**: Intelligent backtracking to constraint conflict sources

### Optimization Integration
- **Linear Programming**: Resource allocation optimization within constraint boundaries
- **Integer Programming**: Discrete assignment problems with logical constraints
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balance competing objectives within constraint limits
- **Heuristic Constraint Handling**: Approximate solutions for NP-hard constraint problems
