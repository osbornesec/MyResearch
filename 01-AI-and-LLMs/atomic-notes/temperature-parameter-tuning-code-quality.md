# Temperature Parameter Tuning for Code Quality Control

## Core Concept

Optimal LLM parameters vary by code type: production code requires temperature 0.1-0.3 for reliability, experimental code uses 0.4-0.7 for creativity, while security-critical code demands 0.1-0.2 with top-k 5-10 for maximum determinism.

## Research Context

Parameter tuning directly impacts code quality, security vulnerability rates, and reliability. Lower temperatures reduce randomness and improve consistency for production systems, while higher values enable creative problem-solving for exploratory development.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Extensive testing across multiple models for coding scenarios
- **Credibility Score**: 8
- **Validation Method**: Empirical testing with quality metrics across different parameter combinations

## Implementation Notes

Production settings: temp 0.2, top-k 15, top-p 0.8 with production-ready system prompts. Security settings: temp 0.1, top-k 10, top-p 0.7 with OWASP-focused prompts. Exploration settings: temp 0.5, top-k 40, top-p 0.9 for creative solutions.
