# Recursive Learning Simulation Methodology

## Core Concept
Recursive learning in prompt engineering simulates a "learning" or "thinking deeper" process by guiding LLMs through an iterative refinement loop: generating initial thoughts, critically evaluating output, and revising based on self-critique. This strategy maximizes accuracy for complex tasks by encouraging deliberate thought processes.

## Research Context
This methodology can be explicitly prompted or implicitly encouraged by techniques like CoT, ToT, Self-Consistency, and ReAct. The recursive loop simulates deeper cognitive processing within the generation process, leading to higher quality outputs through systematic self-improvement.
