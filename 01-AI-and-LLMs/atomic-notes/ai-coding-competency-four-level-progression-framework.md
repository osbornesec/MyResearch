# AI Coding Competency Four-Level Progression Framework

## Core Concept

A structured learning progression model defines four distinct stages for developing AI coding expertise: Level 1 Fluency (basic AI tool use and integration recognition), Level 2 Proficiency (effective prompting and output evaluation), Level 3 Expertise (system integration and peer mentoring), and Level 4 Mastery (innovation leadership and organizational policy development).

## Framework Architecture

### Level 1 - Fluency
**Objective**: Basic AI tool utilization
- Use AI tools for simple coding tasks
- Identify appropriate integration points in existing workflows
- Understand fundamental AI capabilities and limitations
- Demonstrate safe AI tool operation

### Level 2 - Proficiency  
**Objective**: Effective AI interaction
- Craft context-aware prompts for complex coding challenges
- Evaluate AI-generated outputs for quality and correctness
- Manage data limitations and model constraints
- Apply prompt engineering techniques systematically

### Level 3 - Expertise
**Objective**: Advanced integration and mentoring
- Integrate symbolic programming with machine learning approaches
- Design robust AI-human collaboration pipelines
- Mentor peers in AI coding best practices
- Architect complex AI-assisted development workflows

### Level 4 - Mastery
**Objective**: Innovation and organizational leadership
- Innovate novel AI coding frameworks and methodologies
- Lead enterprise AI transformation initiatives
- Shape organizational AI policies and governance structures
- Contribute to AI coding research and community development

## Implementation Considerations

**Progressive Skill Building**: Each level builds systematically on previous competencies, requiring demonstration of mastery before advancement.

**Assessment Integration**: Framework supports both self-assessment and formal evaluation through structured competency measurement.

**Organizational Alignment**: Competency levels map to role responsibilities and career advancement pathways in AI-enhanced development organizations.

## Research Evidence

**Source Validation**: Cross-referenced with UNESCO AI competency framework and AI Alliance Essential Competencies Guide, providing standardized foundation for skill development.

**Educational Application**: Framework enables systematic curriculum design and training program development for AI coding education.
