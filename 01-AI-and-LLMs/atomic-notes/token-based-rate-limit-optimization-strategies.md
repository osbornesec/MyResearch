# Token-Based Rate Limit Optimization Strategies

## Core Concept

Token-based rate limit optimization achieves 40-60% context size reduction through prompt compression, selective context inclusion per agent, response streaming for partial processing, and context rotation to prevent performance degradation while maintaining information integrity and system efficiency.

## Research Context

Fundamental optimization strategy for managing token consumption in distributed AI systems where context accumulation and token limits create scaling constraints. Essential for cost-effective multi-agent deployments.
