# Multi-Turn Conversation Performance Degradation

## Core Concept

Large Language Models exhibit significant performance degradation in multi-turn conversations compared to single-turn interactions, with an average drop of 39% across generation tasks. This degradation occurs universally across all tested models, from small 8B parameter models to state-of-the-art systems like GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

## Research Context

This finding challenges the standard evaluation paradigm for LLMs, which predominantly focuses on single-turn, fully-specified instruction settings. The research demonstrates that lab-like performance metrics may not accurately reflect real-world conversational capabilities where users typically provide underspecified instructions across multiple turns.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: "LLMs Get Lost In Multi-Turn Conversation" (Microsoft Research & Salesforce Research)
- **Credibility Score**: 9
- **Validation Method**: Large-scale simulation with 200,000+ conversations across 15 LLMs and 6 tasks

## Connection Potential

Links to conversation state tracking, user experience design in AI systems, evaluation methodology frameworks, and real-world AI deployment challenges. Connects to existing vault concepts around AI reliability and performance measurement.

## Implementation Notes

Performance degradation manifests regardless of model size, architecture, or training methodology. Even reasoning models with additional test-time compute (o3, Deepseek-R1) show similar degradation patterns, indicating the issue is fundamental to current LLM architectures rather than computational capacity.
