# Iterative Refinement Paradigm Prompt Engineering

## Core Concept
Successful prompt engineering follows an iterative process: creating initial prompts, evaluating outputs against criteria, identifying gaps, refining prompts to address issues, and repeating until satisfactory results are achieved. This represents the central methodology in effective prompt engineering practice and serves as the unifying principle across all effective prompting techniques.

## Evergreen Insights
This paradigm transcends specific techniques and emerges as the fundamental approach underlying all sophisticated prompt engineering, from basic few-shot learning to advanced methods like Tree of Thoughts and ReAct. It represents a meta-methodology that can be applied recursively to improve the refinement process itself.

## Research Foundation
Validated through comprehensive analysis of academic literature and practical implementation guides. The iterative refinement approach consistently outperforms single-attempt prompting across diverse task categories and complexity levels.
