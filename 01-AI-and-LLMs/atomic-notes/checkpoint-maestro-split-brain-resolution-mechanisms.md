# CheckPoint Maestro Split-Brain Resolution Mechanisms

## Core Concept
Split-brain scenarios occur when communication is lost between Maestro sites or orchestrators, causing both sites to assume the "Active" or "Primary" role simultaneously, creating conflicts in routing, synchronization, and data consistency.

## Resolution Mechanisms

### Prevention Technologies
- **VRRP Preempt Mode**: Enabled by default, forces higher-priority nodes to reclaim master status upon recovery
- **Monitored Interfaces**: Interface failures trigger priority reductions via `priority-delta` configuration
- **Auto-deactivation**: Forces SGM withdrawal when priority â‰¤ 0

### Conflict Resolution Workflow
1. **Network Partition Detection**: Loss of heartbeat packets via dedicated HA links
2. **Priority Demotion**: Affected SGM reduces VRRP priority by configured `priority-delta`
3. **Master Election**: SGM with highest remaining priority becomes active
4. **Isolation Protocol**: If all priorities = 0, auto-deactivation isolates the node

### Dual-Site Specific Behaviors
- **Quorum-based Arbitration**: Partitioned sites use quorum mechanisms for master election
- **Connection Synchronization**: Connections sync to one active, one local standby, and one remote standby SGM
- **Authoritative Site Selection**: Manual intervention required to determine which site contains correct, up-to-date configuration

## Research Context
Critical for understanding Maestro failure handling in enterprise dual-site deployments where network partitions can create dangerous split-brain conditions requiring immediate resolution.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Sources**: CheckPoint Maestro Administration Guide, troubleshooting documentation
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10 (Official documentation with verified procedures)
- **Validation Method**: Cross-referenced with CheckPoint support documentation and R81.10/R81.20 release notes

## Connection Potential
Links to VRRP configuration, HA deployment patterns, network monitoring protocols, and disaster recovery procedures.

## Troubleshooting Commands
- `show vrrp virtual-router all` - Verify VRRP preempt settings
- `vrrp monitor-interface <iface> priority-delta <value>` - Check monitored interfaces
- `cphaprob stat` - Check cluster health
- `cphaprob -a if` - Verify interface status
