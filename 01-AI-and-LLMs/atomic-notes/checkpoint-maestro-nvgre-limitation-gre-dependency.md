# CheckPoint Maestro NVGRE Limitation Due to GRE Dependency

## Core Concept
CheckPoint Maestro platforms cannot support NVGRE encapsulation because they fundamentally **do not support GRE interfaces**, and NVGRE relies on Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) as its foundational protocol.

## Technical Details
- **GRE Restriction**: "Scalable Platforms (ElasticXL, Maestro, and Chassis) do not support GRE interfaces"
- **NVGRE Architecture**: Uses GRE encapsulation with 24-bit Virtual Subnet Identifiers (VSID)
- **Impact**: Cannot implement Microsoft Hyper-V network virtualization or Azure hybrid connectivity
- **Alternative**: Limited to 4,000 VLANs versus NVGRE's 16 million virtual networks

## Research Context
This architectural constraint eliminates NVGRE as a viable overlay solution for CheckPoint Maestro deployments, forcing organizations to choose between hyperscale security and Microsoft network virtualization.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Sources**: CheckPoint official documentation, NVGRE RFC specifications
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Cross-referenced GRE limitations with NVGRE technical requirements
