# Evidence-Based Cognitive Task Distribution Framework

## Core Concept
Systematic framework for optimizing cognitive task distribution between human developers and AI systems using Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory with four-category taxonomy based on cognitive load analysis and working memory limitations.

## Research Context
Human cognitive architecture imposes fundamental constraints on software development with working memory limited to 4-7 items simultaneously, creating critical bottlenecks requiring strategic human-AI collaboration optimization.

## Cognitive Load Types
1. **Intrinsic Load**: Inherent task complexity and element interactivity requirements
2. **Extraneous Load**: Environmental factors and context switching overhead  
3. **Germane Load**: Learning and schema construction during development

## Four-Category Task Taxonomy
1. **Category A - Purely Human**: Requirements analysis, architectural decisions, creative problem-solving
2. **Category B - AI-Assisted with Human Oversight**: Code generation with review, testing with human design
3. **Category C - AI-Driven with Human Validation**: Routine formatting, basic bug detection, pattern recognition
4. **Category D - Fully Automated with Exception Handling**: CI/CD, build management, standard operations

## Task-Specific Cognitive Analysis
- **Problem Decomposition**: High intrinsic load due to architectural coherence requirements
- **Algorithm Design**: Highest intrinsic load requiring efficiency-correctness-maintainability balance
- **Debugging**: High extraneous load from context switching and mental model reconstruction
- **Code Review**: Moderate cognitive load requiring sustained attention and domain expertise

## Implementation Principles
- Dual coding theory: Combine visual and textual processing for enhanced performance
- Working memory optimization: Limit concurrent code elements to 5-7 maximum
- Cognitive load distribution: Balance intrinsic, extraneous, and germane loads strategically
