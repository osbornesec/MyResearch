# AI Context Window Diagram Processing Limitations

## Core Concept
Large Mermaid diagrams can exceed AI context windows, requiring specialized strategies: chunking that preserves relationship information, hierarchical processing for global coherence, and summary techniques that capture essential workflow logic without losing semantic meaning.

## Technical Challenges
**Local Context Management:**
- Previously defined nodes and their types
- Current subgraph scope awareness
- Accumulated edge relationships tracking
- Layout directives affecting interpretation

**Global Context Requirements:**
- Domain knowledge about workflow representation
- Business rules governing valid transitions
- Temporal constraints not explicitly encoded
- Stakeholder perspectives and priorities

## Processing Strategies
**Chunking Approaches:**
- Preserve relationship information across boundaries
- Maintain node reference consistency
- Use overlapping context windows for continuity

**Hierarchical Processing:**
- Break complex diagrams into logical subgraphs
- Process top-level structure first, then detailed components
- Maintain global coherence through summary representations

**Summary Techniques:**
- Extract essential workflow logic patterns
- Preserve critical decision points and data flows
- Compress non-essential decorative elements

## Framework Solutions
The LLMermaid framework addresses these limitations through recursive parsing - breaking large diagrams into manageable chunks while preserving semantic relationships and enabling AI systems to process arbitrarily complex workflow representations.

## Scalability Metrics
Rendering performance degrades exponentially beyond 500 nodes, while human comprehension struggles beyond 20-30 nodes, creating an optimal zone for AI-human collaborative diagram design.
