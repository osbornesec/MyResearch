# Dynamic Batching for AI Inference Optimization

## Core Concept
Dynamic batching queues incoming code completion requests into adaptively-sized batches based on current load and latency targets, improving GPU utilization and throughput while maintaining responsiveness requirements for interactive coding sessions.

## Performance Characteristics
- **GPU Utilization**: Improved hardware efficiency through batch processing
- **Throughput Enhancement**: Increased overall system capacity
- **Latency Balance**: Maintaining responsiveness for interactive development
- **Adaptive Sizing**: Batch size adjusts to current load and latency targets

## Technical Implementation
- **Request Queuing**: Incoming completion requests organized into batches
- **Load-Aware Adaptation**: Batch sizing based on system capacity
- **Latency Targeting**: Maintain sub-second response times for interactivity
- **Resource Monitoring**: Real-time system capacity assessment

## Connection Points

## Enterprise Deployment Patterns
- **Multi-Tenant Systems**: Batch optimization across multiple development teams
- **Resource Scaling**: Dynamic allocation based on demand patterns
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduced inference costs through improved GPU utilization
- **SLA Compliance**: Guaranteed latency targets for interactive coding

## Performance Metrics
- **GPU Utilization Rate**: Percentage improvement over non-batched processing
