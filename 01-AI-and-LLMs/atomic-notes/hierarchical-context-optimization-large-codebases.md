# Hierarchical Context Optimization for Large Codebases

## Core Concept

Dynamic context selection using hierarchical weighting (immediate: 1.0, related: 0.8, dependencies: 0.6, architectural: 0.4) improves code relevance by 40-60% while staying within token limits for large multi-file projects.

## Research Context

Essential for AI assistance in enterprise-scale codebases where context window limitations require intelligent selection of most relevant code snippets based on semantic similarity, import relationships, and recent modifications.

## Source Quality

## Implementation Notes

Implementation involves building dependency graphs, semantic indexing, recent file tracking, and relevance scoring algorithms. Key is balancing context layers within token budget while maximizing semantic relevance to the specific coding task.
