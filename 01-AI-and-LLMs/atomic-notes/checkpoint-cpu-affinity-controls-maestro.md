# CheckPoint CPU Affinity Controls in Maestro Architecture

## Core Concept
Maestro employs granular CPU affinity controls to prevent core exhaustion through "automatic affinity" that dynamically redistributes interface assignments every 30 seconds based on utilization thresholds, with CoreXL firewall instances running on isolated cores.

## Implementation Details
- **Automatic Affinity**: Dynamic redistribution every 30 seconds based on utilization thresholds
- **Core Isolation**: CoreXL firewall instances run on isolated cores to prevent acceleration process competition
- **Scaling Event Impact**: New gateways incur transient 60-70% CPU spikes during HyperSync policy synchronization
- **Stabilization Time**: CPU utilization stabilizes within 6 minutes as configurations propagate across nodes

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: CheckPoint Maestro administration guides and performance monitoring documentation
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10 (CheckPoint official documentation)
- **Validation Method**: Cross-referenced with performance tuning guides and real-world deployment metrics

## Connection Potential
Essential for understanding distributed AI system resource management, multi-core processing optimization, and enterprise infrastructure scaling patterns.
