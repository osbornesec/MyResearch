# Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Algorithms

## Core Concept
Structured prompting methodology that guides LLMs through problem analysis, algorithm design, implementation planning, code generation, testing strategy, and optimization for complex algorithmic solutions.

## Why This Matters
Research shows 60-80% improvement in algorithmic problem-solving accuracy when using structured CoT approaches that decompose complex problems into systematic steps.

## Implementation Guidance
- Step 1: Problem analysis (input, output, constraints, edge cases)
- Step 2: Algorithm design (approach, complexity analysis, trade-offs)
- Step 3: Implementation plan (data structures, functions, error handling)
- Step 4: Code implementation with clear structure
- Step 5: Testing strategy (unit, integration, performance tests)
- Step 6: Optimization opportunities identification
