- **Legacy Migration**: 42% effort reduction in legacy code modernization (o4-mini automated API wrapping)
- **Documentation**: 65% faster technical documentation generation

#### Cost-Benefit Analysis Framework
```python
class EnterpriseROICalculator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.developer_hourly_cost = 75  # Blended rate including overhead
        self.ai_tool_costs = {
            'claude_sonnet': 0.12,  # per 1k tokens
            'gpt4o': 0.10,
            'o4_mini': 0.06,
            'self_hosted': 0.08
        }
        
    def calculate_monthly_roi(self, team_size, tool_mix, productivity_gains):
        # Traditional development costs
        baseline_cost = team_size * 160 * self.developer_hourly_cost
        
        # AI tool costs
        ai_costs = self.calculate_tool_costs(tool_mix, team_size)
        
        # Productivity value
        productivity_value = baseline_cost * productivity_gains['velocity_improvement']
        
        # Quality improvements (reduced debugging, fewer bugs)
        quality_savings = baseline_cost * productivity_gains['quality_improvement']
        
        return (productivity_value + quality_savings - ai_costs) / baseline_cost
```
