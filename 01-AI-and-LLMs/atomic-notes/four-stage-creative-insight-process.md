# Four-Stage Creative Insight Process

## Core Concept

Creative insight follows four distinct neurocognitive stages: preparation (theta oscillations in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during problem encoding), incubation (default mode network dominance during rest), illumination (gamma bursts in right temporal lobe with pupil dilation), and verification (beta-band synchronization in anterior cingulate for error monitoring).

## Research Context

Provides neurobiological framework for understanding and potentially enhancing creative processes in knowledge work. Critical for designing PKM systems that support all stages of creative insight generation.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Cognitive Science PKM Research 2024 (Creativity Research section)
- **Credibility Score**: 9
- **Validation Method**: High-density EEG and intracranial recordings with meta-analytic validation

## Connection Potential

Links to creativity research, default mode network, innovation methodologies, incubation techniques, and neurofeedback systems for creative enhancement.

## Implementation Notes

- Support preparation phase with structured problem encoding tools
- Protect incubation periods with minimal cognitive interference
- Detect illumination moments through physiological monitoring
- Provide verification tools for insight validation and refinement
- Design workflows that respect natural creative rhythms

## Evolution Notes
