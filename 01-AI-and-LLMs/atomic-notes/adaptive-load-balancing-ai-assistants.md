# Adaptive Load Balancing for AI Assistants

## Core Concept
Dynamic AI assistant activation based on project context optimizes workflow by enabling or disabling specific tools according to domain expertiseâ€”for example, disabling Copilot for test files when CodeWhisperer excels in that specific area.

## Performance Impact
- **Cognitive Load Reduction**: Fewer concurrent tools reduce decision complexity
- **Context-Aware Optimization**: Tools matched to domain expertise maximize effectiveness
- **Resource Efficiency**: Selective activation reduces computational overhead
- **Workflow Optimization**: Best tool for specific development scenarios

## Implementation Framework
- **Dynamic Activation**: Tools enabled/disabled based on project context
- **Domain Expertise Mapping**: Tool capabilities matched to file types and tasks
- **Context Awareness**: Project type, file type, task type considerations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track effectiveness of tool assignments

## Connection Points
