# Few-Shot Prompting Effectiveness

## Core Concept
Few-shot prompting with 2-3 relevant examples consistently outperforms zero-shot approaches by 28.3 percentage points for code generation quality, with 85-92% pass rates versus 65-75% for zero-shot.

## Why This Matters
Research from MSR 2025 conference demonstrates that providing examples significantly improves AI code generation quality, security, and human evaluation ratings compared to instruction-only prompts.

## Implementation Guidance
- Include 2-3 relevant examples demonstrating desired patterns
- Show proper error handling and edge case management
- Include comprehensive docstrings and type hints
- Demonstrate testing approaches when applicable
- Match examples to specific task context for maximum relevance
