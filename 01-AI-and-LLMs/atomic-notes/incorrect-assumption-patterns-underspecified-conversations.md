# Incorrect Assumption Patterns in Underspecified Conversations

## Core Concept

LLMs systematically make incorrect assumptions when faced with underspecified instructions in multi-turn conversations, filling gaps in missing information based on statistical patterns rather than seeking clarification. These assumptions become entrenched in subsequent turns, leading to persistent misalignment with user intent even when corrective information is provided.

## Research Context

This pattern represents a fundamental limitation in how current LLMs handle uncertainty and incomplete information. Rather than acknowledging gaps or asking clarifying questions, models demonstrate overconfidence in their ability to infer missing requirements, leading to solution paths that become increasingly difficult to correct as conversations progress.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: "LLMs Get Lost In Multi-Turn Conversation" - Section 6.2 and root cause analysis
- **Credibility Score**: 9
- **Validation Method**: Systematic analysis of conversation failures across 200,000+ simulated interactions

## Connection Potential

Links to uncertainty quantification in AI, cognitive bias research, conversation design methodologies, and AI safety considerations. Connects to existing concepts around AI reliability, user trust calibration, and conversational AI architecture patterns.

## Implementation Notes

Assumption patterns become particularly problematic in complex generative tasks requiring multiple explicit specifications. Models show tendency to fill information gaps immediately rather than maintaining uncertainty states, leading to premature commitment to potentially incorrect solution paths. This behavior is consistent across model sizes and architectures.
