# Integration Overhead Scaling Metrics

## Core Concept
Empirical analysis reveals each additional AI tool adds 10-15ms latency and 5% more configuration variance, compounding non-linearly beyond three tools, demonstrating measurable integration overhead that must be considered in tool selection decisions.

## Research Context
Critical performance data for AI tool ecosystem planning, providing quantitative evidence for optimization decisions and establishing empirical baselines for multi-tool integration costs and benefits.
