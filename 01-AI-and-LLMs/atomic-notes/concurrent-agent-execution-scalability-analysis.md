# Concurrent Agent Execution Scalability Analysis

## Core Concept

Concurrent agent execution demonstrates predictable efficiency degradation patterns: 1-10 agents achieve 99% efficiency, 10-50 agents maintain 97% efficiency, 50-100 agents drop to 90% efficiency, and 100-500 agents achieve 80% efficiency, with coordination overhead increasing from <1% to 15-25% as agent count scales.

## Research Context

Essential for determining optimal agent allocation strategies in swarm intelligence implementations. Provides quantitative framework for resource planning and performance prediction in distributed AI systems requiring multi-agent coordination.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Claude Code Swarm Intelligence Performance Analysis 2025 by Dr. Lisa Wang
- **Credibility Score**: 8
- **Validation Method**: Performance benchmarking with systematic efficiency measurement across agent count ranges

## Connection Potential

Links to swarm coordination performance bottlenecks, distributed AI systems resource management, memory usage patterns, API utilization metrics, and auto-scaling implementation strategies.

## Implementation Notes

Efficiency calculation includes memory usage scaling (50MB-30GB), API utilization rates (10%-100%), and coordination overhead percentages. Critical thresholds: 50 agents for near-linear scaling, 100 agents for distributed patterns, 500+ agents for federated architectures.
