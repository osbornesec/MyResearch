# Multi-Turn Conversation Root Causes

## Core Concept
Four primary causes of LLM multi-turn degradation: premature solution attempts with assumptions, over-reliance on previous incorrect attempts, loss of middle-turn information, and overly verbose responses introducing confusion.

## Why This Matters
Identifying specific failure modes enables targeted interventions and training approaches to improve multi-turn conversation reliability rather than general capability enhancement.

## Implementation Guidance
- Monitor for premature answer attempts before full specification
- Detect over-reliance on previous incorrect solutions
- Implement attention mechanisms to maintain middle-turn information
- Control response verbosity to reduce assumption introduction
- Design prompts that discourage early solution commitment
- Create mechanisms for course-correction when assumptions prove incorrect
