# Vercel SDK TypeScript Type-Safe API Client

## Core Concept

The Vercel SDK (@vercel/sdk) is a TypeScript-first client library that provides type-safe access to Vercel's REST API through Zod schema validation, automatic type generation, and comprehensive error handling.

## Key Characteristics

- **Full Type Safety**: All API calls and responses are strictly typed using Zod schemas
- **Authentication**: Uses bearer token authentication via personal access tokens
- **Installation**: `npm i @vercel/sdk`
- **Tree-Shaking**: Optimized bundling with 43% smaller bundle sizes in v1.2
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry strategies with exponential backoff

## Technical Implementation

```typescript
import { Vercel } from '@vercel/sdk';

const vercel = new Vercel({ 
  bearerToken: process.env.VERCEL_TOKEN 
});
```

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Vercel Official Documentation
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Multi-source verification via Perplexity research
