# Legacy Code Integration Prompting Patterns

## Core Concept

Legacy-aware prompting frameworks use systematic pattern analysis, adapter design, and risk mitigation strategies to enable safe integration of AI-generated code with existing legacy systems while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Research Context

Critical for enterprise environments where AI assistance must respect existing architectural patterns, naming conventions, and business-critical constraints while enabling incremental modernization without disrupting production systems.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Enterprise legacy system integration studies
- **Credibility Score**: 8
- **Validation Method**: Case studies across multiple legacy technology stacks

## Connection Potential

## Implementation Notes

Four-step framework: (1) Pattern analysis of existing conventions and dependencies, (2) Adapter design for interface compatibility, (3) Implementation following legacy patterns with gradual modernization, (4) Testing strategy including regression tests and rollback procedures.

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Created from foundational prompt engineering research
- **Future**: Develop technology-specific legacy integration templates and success metrics
