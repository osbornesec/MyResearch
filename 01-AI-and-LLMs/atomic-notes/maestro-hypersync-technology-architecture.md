# Maestro HyperSync Technology Architecture

## Core Concept
CheckPoint Maestro's HyperSync technology uses UDP protocol 8116 for real-time delta synchronization between Security Gateway Modules, enabling linear scaling with sub-1% overhead per gateway addition.

## Technical Implementation
- **Protocol**: UDP port 8116 for Cluster Control Protocol
- **Synchronization Method**: Delta-based state updates (only changes transmitted)
- **Redundancy Model**: N+1 architecture with active orchestrator consensus
- **Performance Impact**: ~1% overhead per SGM added to Security Group
- **Latency Requirement**: â‰¤1ms for dual-site external sync links

## Key Benefits
- **Real-time State Consistency**: Connection tables synchronized across all SGMs
- **Linear Scaling**: Performance scales predictably with gateway additions
- **Efficient Bandwidth Usage**: Only state deltas transmitted, not full tables
- **Split-brain Prevention**: Orchestrator consensus prevents network partition issues

- #builds-on [[distributed-state-synchronization-protocols]]
- #enables [[zero-downtime-security-scaling]]
