# Four-Level Hierarchical XAI Architecture Pattern

## Core Concept
Explainable AI coding systems require four-level hierarchical explanation frameworks that mirror human cognitive processing: architectural reasoning, algorithmic justification, line-by-line decisions, and alternative approach comparisons.

## Research Context
Modern AI code generation systems need transparency at multiple granularity levels to build developer trust and provide educational value. This addresses the critical need for explainable AI in software development.

## Four Explanation Levels
1. **High-Level Architectural Reasoning**: Overall design decisions and structural choices
2. **Algorithmic Choice Justification**: Why specific algorithms and data structures were chosen
3. **Line-by-Line Code Decisions**: Detailed justifications for individual statements
4. **Alternative Approach Comparisons**: Why other solutions were not selected

## Technical Implementation
- Attention mechanisms in transformer models highlight architectural dependencies
- Feature attribution methods (SHAP, LIME) identify influencing input elements
- Counterfactual reasoning explores alternative implementations
- Uncertainty-aware chain-of-thought reasoning provides confidence-weighted explanations

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Advanced Explainable AI Coding Systems framework
