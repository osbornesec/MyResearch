# Custom MCP Development for Inter-Agent Communication

## Core Concept

Advanced swarm intelligence requires custom MCP development for direct inter-agent communication capabilities including message passing between agents, broadcast functionality, subscription mechanisms, agent discovery protocols, and capability negotiation - features not available in the current centralized MCP architecture.

## Research Context

This represents a critical gap in current MCP capabilities for true swarm intelligence, identifying specific development requirements for enabling direct agent-to-agent coordination beyond the host-mediated communication patterns currently possible.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: MCP Swarm Intelligence Orchestration Analysis 2025, Section 5.1.1
- **Credibility Score**: 8
- **Validation Method**: Gap analysis against current MCP capabilities and swarm intelligence requirements

## Connection Potential

- Links to distributed communication protocols and messaging architectures
- Connects to agent discovery and capability negotiation patterns
- Relates to custom MCP development roadmap and implementation priorities
- Foundation for advanced swarm coordination engine development

## Implementation Notes

Proposed AgentCommunicationMCP interface includes sendMessage() for direct agent messaging, broadcast() for multicast communication, subscribe() for event handling, discoverAgents() for network topology, and negotiateCapabilities() for dynamic coordination. Implementation timeline estimated at 0-3 months for foundation capabilities.

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Created from Smart Extraction of custom MCP requirements
- **Future**: Needs connection to implementation timeline and technical architecture details
