## Core Concept

Adaptive prompting systems dynamically adjust prompts based on context analysis, user patterns, and real-time feedback to optimize AI assistance effectiveness through personalized prompt engineering that evolves with user behavior and project requirements.

## Content

### Core Adaptation Framework
```python
class AdaptivePromptingSystem:
    def adaptive_generate(self, base_prompt, context, user_id, adaptation_level):
        # 1. Analyze current project and development context
        context_analysis = self.context_analyzer.analyze(context)
        
        # 2. Retrieve user profile and historical patterns
        user_profile = self.user_profiler.get_profile(user_id)
        
        # 3. Enhance prompt based on context and user factors
        adapted_prompt = self._adapt_prompt(
            base_prompt, context_analysis, user_profile, adaptation_level
        )
        
        # 4. Generate with enhanced prompt and record results
        result = self.base_model.generate(adapted_prompt)
        self._record_adaptation(base_prompt, adapted_prompt, result, context)
```

### Context Analysis Dimensions
- **Project Type**: Web application, API service, mobile app, general software
- **Technology Stack**: Languages, frameworks, libraries, tools in use
- **Existing Patterns**: Code patterns and architectural choices in codebase
- **Complexity Level**: Assessment of task and codebase complexity
- **Quality Requirements**: Testing, security, performance standards

### User Profiling Components
- **Experience Level**: Beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert assessment
- **Preferred Patterns**: Successful coding patterns and approaches
- **Common Issues**: Historical problems and error patterns
- **Coding Style**: Naming conventions, documentation preferences, error handling style
- **Domain Expertise**: Areas of specialized knowledge and familiarity
- **Learning Pace**: Rate of skill acquisition and adaptation to new concepts

### Adaptation Strategies
- **Context-Specific Examples**: Include relevant patterns from similar projects
- **Experience-Appropriate Complexity**: Match explanation depth to user level
- **Technology-Focused Guidance**: Emphasize familiar frameworks and tools
- **Issue Prevention**: Include warnings about user's common mistake patterns
- **Style Consistency**: Match organizational or personal coding standards

### Real-Time Optimization
```python
class RealTimePromptOptimizer:
    def optimize_prompt_real_time(self, prompt, feedback, optimization_strategy):
        # 1. Extract optimization signals from user feedback
        optimization_signals = self.feedback_analyzer.extract_signals(feedback)
        
        # 2. Generate multiple optimization candidates
        candidates = self._generate_optimization_candidates(
            prompt, optimization_signals, optimization_strategy
        )
        
        # 3. Evaluate and select best optimization approach
        best_candidate = self._evaluate_candidates(candidates, optimization_signals)
        
        # 4. Apply optimization and record for learning
        optimized_prompt = self._apply_optimization(prompt, best_candidate)
```

### Feedback Signal Types
- **Code Quality Feedback**: Correctness, readability, maintainability, efficiency scores
- **User Satisfaction**: Overall rating, ease of use, usefulness assessments
- **Performance Metrics**: Task completion time, iteration requirements, success rates
- **Error Patterns**: Common failure modes and correction requirements

### Key Benefits
- **Personalized assistance**: Tailored to individual developer needs and patterns
- **Context awareness**: Adapts to specific project requirements and constraints
- **Continuous improvement**: Learns and optimizes from user interactions
- **Reduced cognitive load**: Minimizes irrelevant information and complexity
- **Efficiency gains**: Faster task completion through targeted guidance
