# AI-Tagged Commits for Attribution

## Core Concept
Embedding AI flags in commit metadata (e.g., "Co-authored-by: AI-Tool") enables filtering and analytics for AI vs human contributions, providing clear attribution mechanisms that support auditing, compliance, and performance analysis over time.

## Research Context
Essential version control adaptation for AI-assisted development, enabling systematic tracking of AI contributions for accountability, legal compliance, and development process optimization through data-driven insights.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Specialized Version Control and Change Management for AI-Generated Code
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10
- **Validation Method**: Version control best practices analysis

## Connection Potential
- Links to watermarking techniques
- Connects to model identity embedding
- Relates to commit lineage statistics
- Bridges to repository telemetry dashboards

## Implementation Details
- **Metadata Enhancement**: AI flags embedded in standard Git commit metadata
- **Attribution Support**: Clear marking of AI vs human contributions
- **Filtering Capability**: Enable systematic querying and analysis
- **Audit Trail**: Support for compliance and accountability requirements
- **Analytics Foundation**: Data for performance measurement and optimization
