# Claude Code ANR Detection System

## Core Concept

Claude Code borrows Application Not Responding (ANR) detection from mobile development to monitor long-running operations, automatically timing out operations after 5 seconds to prevent system unresponsiveness and maintain interactive performance.

## Implementation Architecture

**ANR Detection Mechanism**:
- 5-second timeout threshold for all async operations
- Promise.race pattern between operation and timeout
- Automatic operation cancellation on timeout detection
- Maintains system responsiveness during complex AI processing

**Technical Pattern**:
```typescript
Promise.race([
  operation(),
  timeoutPromise(5000)
])
```

## Research Context

This approach adapts mobile development patterns to AI coding environments where LLM operations can have unpredictable execution times. ANR detection ensures that the system remains responsive even when individual operations encounter delays or infinite loops.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Claude Code technical architecture deep dive
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10 (implementation details with timeout specifications)
- **Validation Method**: Mobile development pattern adaptation verified

## Connection Potential

Links to: mobile development patterns, timeout mechanisms, system responsiveness, async operation monitoring, user experience optimization

## Key Insight

Adapting mobile ANR detection to AI coding environments demonstrates how cross-domain architectural patterns can solve responsiveness challenges in systems with unpredictable operation durations.
