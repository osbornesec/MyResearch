## Core Concept

Hybrid vector-graph memory architecture combines semantic vector search capabilities across 19+ supported providers with structured graph database entity relationship tracking, enabling comprehensive memory retrieval through parallel storage and search across both semantic similarity and structured knowledge dimensions.

## Research Context

Advanced approach to AI memory systems that overcomes limitations of pure vector or pure graph approaches. Enables both semantic memory retrieval and structured entity relationship discovery for complex AI interactions.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Mem0 technical architecture analysis with benchmarked performance claims
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10
- **Validation Method**: LOCOMO benchmark evaluation with multi-system comparison

## Implementation Notes

**Three-Tier Storage Architecture**:

**Vector Database Layer**:
- Semantic similarity search across 19+ supported providers
- Embeddings-based memory content search
- Metadata storage for session identifiers and timestamps
- Supports: Chroma, Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate, FAISS, Elasticsearch, PGVector, others

**Graph Database Layer**:
- Neo4j-based entity relationship tracking (optional)
- Dynamic schema based on extracted entities and relationships
- Structured knowledge representation and traversal
- Entity connection discovery and relationship mapping

**SQLite History Layer**:
- Complete audit trail of memory operations
- Operation logging and rollback capabilities
- Change tracking and memory evolution history

**Parallel Processing Pattern**:
```python
with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    future_vector = executor.submit(search_vector_store, query, filters)
    future_graph = executor.submit(search_graph, query, filters)
    
    vector_memories = future_vector.result()    # Semantic matches
    graph_entities = future_graph.result()      # Related entities
```

**Combined Search Results**:
- Semantic memory matches from vector search
- Related entity networks from graph traversal
- Unified result set for comprehensive memory retrieval
