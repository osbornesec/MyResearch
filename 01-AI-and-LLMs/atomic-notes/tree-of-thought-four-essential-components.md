## Core Concept

Tree-of-Thought implementation requires four fundamental components that work together to enable systematic exploration of solution spaces: Thought Decomposition, Thought Generation, State Evaluation, and Search Strategy.

## Content

### Component 1: Thought Decomposition
**Purpose**: Breaking complex programming problems into manageable intermediate steps
**Function**: Defines the granularity and structure of reasoning steps

**Application Strategies**:
- **Algorithmic**: problem_analysis → approach_selection → implementation → optimization
- **Debugging**: symptom_analysis → hypothesis_generation → testing → resolution  
- **Architecture**: requirements_analysis → pattern_selection → design → validation
- **Refactoring**: code_analysis → improvement_identification → strategy_selection → implementation

### Component 2: Thought Generation  
**Purpose**: Generating multiple solution branches from current state
**Function**: Creates diverse reasoning paths for exploration

**Key Parameters**:
- Branching factor (typically 3-5 alternatives)
- Strategy diversity requirements
- Implementation approach variation
- Complexity estimation for each branch

### Component 3: State Evaluation
**Purpose**: Scoring thoughts based on multiple criteria
**Function**: Enables systematic comparison and selection of promising paths

**Evaluation Dimensions**:
- Solution feasibility
- Implementation complexity
- Performance implications
- Maintainability considerations
- Risk assessment

### Component 4: Search Strategy
**Purpose**: Determining how to navigate the solution tree
**Function**: Balances exploration vs exploitation in solution space

**Common Strategies**:
- Breadth-first: Explore all options at each level
- Depth-first: Follow promising paths to completion
- Best-first: Always pursue highest-scoring options
- Hybrid: Adaptive strategy based on problem characteristics

### Integration Principles

All four components must work cohesively:
1. **Decomposition** defines the problem structure
2. **Generation** creates solution alternatives  
3. **Evaluation** guides path selection
4. **Search** orchestrates the exploration process

### Critical Success Factors

- **Appropriate granularity**: Thoughts must be neither too high-level nor too detailed
- **Diverse generation**: Multiple genuinely different approaches required
- **Multi-criteria evaluation**: Single metrics often miss important trade-offs
- **Adaptive search**: Strategy must match problem characteristics
