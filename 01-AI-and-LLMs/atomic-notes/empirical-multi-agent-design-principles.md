## Core Concept

Empirical Multi-Agent Design Principles are evidence-based guidelines derived from systematic optimization of multi-agent systems, establishing foundational practices for building effective LLM-based collaborative systems.

## Research Context

These principles emerge from comprehensive analysis of high-performing multi-agent systems discovered through systematic optimization, providing practical guidance for practitioners designing multi-agent AI systems.

## Connection Potential

Links to multi-agent system architecture, prompt optimization strategies, topology selection methodologies, and AI system design best practices.

## Implementation Notes

### Core Design Principles

#### 1. Optimize Individual Agents Before Composition
- **Principle**: Individual agent optimization is crucial before multi-agent composition
- **Evidence**: 6% average performance gain from block-level optimization over single-agent baseline
- **Implementation**: Apply automatic prompt optimization to each agent role independently
- **Rationale**: Prevents compounding effects from ill-formed agents with manual prompts

#### 2. Build Systems with Influential Topologies
- **Principle**: Effective multi-agent systems compose only topologies with demonstrated positive influence
- **Evidence**: Beneficial topologies represent small fraction of full design space
- **Implementation**: Use incremental influence measurement (Iₐᵢ = E(a*ᵢ) / E(a*₀)) for selection
- **Rationale**: Avoid computational waste on ineffective configurations

#### 3. Model Agent Interdependence Through Joint Optimization
- **Principle**: Agent interactions require explicit optimization beyond individual agent optimization
- **Evidence**: Additional ~2% performance gain from workflow-level prompt optimization
- **Implementation**: Conduct global prompt optimization on selected topology configuration
- **Rationale**: Interdependence between agents needs specialized optimization for coordination

#### 4. Apply Sequential Optimization Stages
- **Principle**: Interleave optimization from local to global scope to manage complexity
- **Evidence**: Three-stage process consistently outperforms joint optimization approaches
- **Implementation**: Block-level → Topology → Workflow-level optimization sequence
- **Rationale**: Reduces combinatorial complexity while maintaining optimization effectiveness

#### 5. Focus Computational Budget on Prompt Design Space
- **Principle**: Prompt optimization provides superior token-effectiveness compared to agent scaling
- **Evidence**: Prompt optimization demonstrates significant advantages over scaling approaches
- **Implementation**: Prioritize APO investment before considering additional agents
- **Rationale**: Better return on computational investment through quality over quantity

### Domain-Specific Guidelines

#### Reasoning Tasks
- **Preferred Topology**: Aggregate topology with 5-9 agents
- **Key Finding**: Parallel diverse reasoning followed by aggregation most effective
- **Example Performance**: 84.67% accuracy on MATH dataset

#### Long-Context Understanding
- **Preferred Topology**: Combination of summarize + aggregate + debate
- **Key Finding**: Information distillation before multi-perspective analysis
- **Example Performance**: 69.91% accuracy on HotpotQA

#### Code Generation
- **Preferred Topology**: Aggregate + reflect + execute combination
- **Key Finding**: Diverse generation with iterative refinement and validation
- **Example Performance**: 91.67% accuracy on HumanEval

### Implementation Strategy

#### Validation Protocol
- **Multi-Round Evaluation**: Minimum 3 evaluation runs per configuration for stability
- **Held-Out Testing**: Separate validation and test sets for reliable performance measurement
- **Statistical Significance**: Ensure improvements exceed noise threshold before adoption
- **Cross-Domain Testing**: Validate principles across multiple task domains

#### Resource Allocation
- **80/20 Rule**: Allocate 80% of optimization budget to prompt design, 20% to topology search
- **Stage Progression**: Only proceed to next optimization stage when current stage converges
- **Budget Constraints**: Respect maximum agent limits based on computational resources
- **Efficiency Monitoring**: Track token-effectiveness throughout optimization process

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Extracted from systematic analysis of best-performing MASS-optimized systems
- **Future**: Validate principles across additional domains and multi-agent frameworks
