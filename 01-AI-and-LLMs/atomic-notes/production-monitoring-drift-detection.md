# Production Monitoring and Drift Detection

## Core Concept
Real-time monitoring system for AI models in production that tracks performance degradation, detects data drift, and triggers automated responses including retraining and rollback procedures.

## Model Performance Tracking
- **Prediction Distribution Monitoring**: Mean, standard deviation, percentile tracking
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Classification and regression performance validation
- **Real-time Alerting**: Threshold-based notification system
- **Historical Analysis**: Trend identification and performance comparison

## Data Drift Detection
- **Statistical Tests**: Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Population Stability Index (PSI)
- **Numerical Drift**: Distribution shift detection for continuous variables
- **Categorical Drift**: Chi-square testing for discrete variables
- **Severity Classification**: Low, medium, high drift categorization

## Automated Response System
- **Immediate Rollback**: Critical performance degradation triggers
- **Scheduled Retraining**: Medium severity drift response
- **High-Priority Alerts**: Severe drift notification system
- **MLOps Integration**: Automated pipeline triggering

## Monitoring Infrastructure
- **Batch Processing**: Regular prediction batch analysis
- **Stream Processing**: Real-time monitoring capabilities
- **Metrics Storage**: Historical performance data retention
- **Dashboard Integration**: Visualization and reporting systems

## Alert Configuration
- **Accuracy Thresholds**: Minimum performance requirements
- **Drift Thresholds**: PSI scores and statistical significance levels
- **Response Times**: SLA-based notification timing
- **Escalation Procedures**: Severity-based alert routing

## Integration Patterns
- **Kubernetes Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana integration
- **MLOps Platforms**: MLflow, Kubeflow pipeline integration
- **Notification Systems**: Slack, PagerDuty, email integration
- **Database Integration**: Metrics storage and retrieval systems
