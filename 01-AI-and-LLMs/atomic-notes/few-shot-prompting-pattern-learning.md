# Few-Shot Prompting Pattern Learning

## Core Concept
Few-shot prompting provides 3-5 input/output examples to help models understand patterns and nuances in desired output that might be difficult to explain through instructions alone. Each example can be seen as an iteration that helps the model better understand the task, exemplifying the iterative refinement approach through progressive pattern demonstration.

## Research Context
Few-shot prompting is particularly valuable for tasks requiring specific formats, specialized knowledge, or nuanced understanding. The prompt engineer iteratively selects, refines, and reorganizes examples to optimize performance, creating a trade-off between guidance and context window space.
