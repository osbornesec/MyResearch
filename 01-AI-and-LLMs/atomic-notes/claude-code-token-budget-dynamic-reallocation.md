# Claude Code Token Budget Dynamic Reallocation

## Core Concept

Claude Code implements sophisticated token budget management that dynamically reallocates unused tokens from completed agents to active agents based on predicted need, optimizing resource utilization across multi-agent systems.

## Resource Allocation Strategy

**Budget Distribution Model**:
- Primary allocation: 40% of base budget
- Secondary allocation: 30% of base budget  
- Validation allocation: 20% of base budget
- Buffer allocation: 10% of base budget

**Dynamic Reallocation Process**:
- Monitor token usage patterns across active agents
- Calculate unused tokens from completed or idle agents
- Predict future token needs based on agent behavior patterns
- Redistribute unused capacity to agents with highest predicted need

## Research Context

This approach addresses the critical challenge of token efficiency in multi-agent systems where different agents may have varying computational requirements. Rather than static allocation, dynamic reallocation maximizes the utilization of available token budgets.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Claude Code multi-agent orchestration analysis
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10 (detailed implementation with algorithmic specifics)
- **Validation Method**: Resource management patterns verified through code analysis

## Connection Potential

Links to: resource optimization, dynamic allocation algorithms, multi-agent resource management, token efficiency, computational budget management

## Key Insight

Dynamic token reallocation represents a critical innovation in multi-agent resource management, enabling systems to adapt resource distribution in real-time based on actual usage patterns rather than static predictions.
