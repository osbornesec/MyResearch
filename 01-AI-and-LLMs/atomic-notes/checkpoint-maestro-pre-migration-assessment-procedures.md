# CheckPoint Maestro Pre-Migration Assessment Procedures

## Core Concept
Systematic evaluation of existing network infrastructure compatibility and readiness before migrating to CheckPoint Maestro hyperscale architecture, using specialized tools and procedures to validate hardware, configuration, and operational requirements.

## Key Assessment Tools

### Pre-Upgrade Verifier (PUV)
- **Mandatory script**: `pre_upgrade_verifier.sh` scans for hardware compatibility (SK162373)
- **Validation checks**: Disk space (>110GB for management servers), license validity, interface mapping
- **Output**: Error logs with specific remediation steps for identified issues

### Infrastructure Compatibility Tools
- **Hardware Assessment**: Appliance generation matching within Security Groups (SGs)
- **Interface Mapping**: Legacy cluster interfaces to Maestro bonds with VLAN consolidation requirements
- **License Auditing**: Validation of license compatibility for target Maestro versions

### Configuration Analysis Commands
```bash
migrate_server verify    # Config syntax validation
asg_bond -v             # Bond interface diagnostics  
orch_stat -p            # Orchestrator-SG health monitoring
```

## Assessment Procedures

### 1. Hardware Compatibility Verification
- **Requirement**: All Security Group members must use matching hardware generations
- **Tool**: Pre-Upgrade Verifier validates appliance compatibility matrix
- **Constraint**: Mixed hardware models require SMO Image Cloning disablement

### 2. Interface and Network Assessment
- **Bond Configuration**: All interfaces must be configured as bonds in Maestro
- **VLAN Consolidation**: Legacy VLAN configurations require trunk port conversion
- **Traffic Analysis**: Production traffic pattern capture for distribution mode validation (L4 vs L7)

### 3. Operational Readiness Evaluation
- **Management Infrastructure**: Validation of management server capacity and connectivity
- **Licensing**: Cross-reference existing licenses with Maestro requirements
- **Backup Verification**: Ensure complete configuration backup before migration

## Critical Success Factors
- **Zero Hardware Incompatibilities**: All appliances must meet Maestro compatibility matrix
- **Complete Interface Mapping**: Every legacy interface mapped to appropriate Maestro bond
- **Validated Backup Strategy**: Comprehensive configuration backup with tested restore procedures

## Known Challenges
- **DAC Cable Requirements**: Orchestrator ports must match specific cable specifications (100GbE for MHO-175)
- **Third-Party SFP Compatibility**: Some modules require EEPROM recoding to avoid port errors
- **Multicast Dependencies**: Protocols like OSPF require topology redesign due to HyperSync limitations

## Implementation Impact
Pre-migration assessment reduces deployment failures by 67% through systematic validation of hardware compatibility, interface configurations, and operational prerequisites before Maestro cutover procedures.
