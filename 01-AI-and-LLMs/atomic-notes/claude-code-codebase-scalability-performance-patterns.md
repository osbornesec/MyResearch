## Core Concept

Claude Code demonstrates variable performance scaling: near-instantaneous response for 1K files with >90% accuracy, degraded performance (60-80% accuracy) for 10K files requiring optimization, and unpredictable results for 100K+ files necessitating strategic decomposition.

## Research Context

Essential for engineering teams planning Claude Code deployment across different project scales. Enables performance expectations and optimization strategy development.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Empirical performance studies and technical documentation
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10
- **Validation Method**: Multiple performance benchmarks and real-world testing

## Implementation Notes

**Performance by Project Size**:

**Small Codebases (1K Files)**:
- Response Time: Near-instantaneous
- Accuracy: >90% success rate
- Context Fit: Full project within 200K token window

**Medium Codebases (10K Files)**:
- Response Time: Seconds to minutes with agentic search
- Accuracy: 60-80% success rate
- Optimization Required: Iterative refinement essential

**Large Codebases (100K+ Files)**:
- Response Time: Minutes to hours for monorepo tasks
- Accuracy: Unpredictable ("mind-blowing" vs "utter failure")
- Strategy: Strategic decomposition required
