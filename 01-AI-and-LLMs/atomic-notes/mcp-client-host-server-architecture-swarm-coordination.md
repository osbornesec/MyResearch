# MCP Client-Host-Server Architecture for Swarm Coordination

## Core Concept

Model Context Protocol operates on a centralized client-host-server architecture where the Claude Code host process contains multiple MCP clients (Sequential Thinking, Perplexity, Context7, Supabase, Puppeteer, TaskMaster) that connect to specialized external servers, enabling coordinated swarm intelligence through host-mediated communication patterns rather than direct inter-agent messaging.

## Research Context

This architectural understanding is fundamental for implementing swarm intelligence systems using existing MCP tools, as it reveals both the coordination opportunities through specialized role assignment and the constraints requiring alternative communication patterns for true distributed intelligence.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: MCP Swarm Intelligence Orchestration Analysis 2025, Context7 MCP Documentation
- **Credibility Score**: 8
- **Validation Method**: Cross-referenced with official MCP specification and architecture documentation

## Connection Potential

- Links to multi-agent system patterns in AI orchestration
- Connects to distributed system architectures and coordination protocols
- Relates to specialized agent role definitions and task distribution patterns
- Foundation for understanding MCP protocol limitations and hybrid coordination requirements

## Implementation Notes

The architecture enables swarm coordination through three primary mechanisms: host-mediated message passing, shared state coordination via Supabase MCP, and event-driven coordination via TaskMaster MCP. Each client-server pair maintains isolated state unless explicitly shared through the coordination layer.

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Created from Smart Extraction of MCP swarm intelligence analysis
- **Future**: Needs connection to custom MCP development requirements and performance optimization patterns
