# Role-Based Prompting for Domain Expertise

## Core Concept

Role-based prompting leverages specialized domain knowledge by assigning expert personas (senior developer, architect, DevOps engineer, QA engineer) to achieve 20-35% improvement in domain-specific accuracy through targeted expertise application.

## Research Context

Essential for complex software projects requiring specialized knowledge in domains like financial systems, healthcare, security, or specific architectural patterns where generic prompting lacks necessary domain context and compliance requirements.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Domain-specific accuracy studies in expert role assignment
- **Credibility Score**: 8
- **Validation Method**: Comparative analysis across multiple domain specializations

## Implementation Notes

Multi-role collaborative approach involves architect for system design, senior developer for implementation, DevOps for deployment, and QA for testing. Domain-specific roles (e.g., fintech developer) include specialized requirements like PCI DSS compliance, regulatory adherence, and security standards.
