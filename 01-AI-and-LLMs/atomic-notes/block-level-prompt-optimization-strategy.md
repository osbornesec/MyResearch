## Core Concept

Block-level prompt optimization is the first stage of MASS framework that focuses on optimizing individual agent prompts before composition into multi-agent systems, ensuring each agent is primed for its role with the most effective instructions.

## Optimization Strategy

### Warm-Up Phase
- Start with single-agent APO (Automatic Prompt Optimization): a*₀ ← O_D(a₀)
- Jointly optimize both instruction and exemplars using modular prompt optimizer O
- Establish baseline predictor performance before multi-agent composition

### Building Block Optimization
- Optimize each topology with minimum number of agents: a*ᵢ ← O_D(aᵢ | a*₀)
- Condition optimization on the warmed predictor from warm-up phase
- Use minimal topology configurations (e.g., 2 predictors + 1 debator for debate topology)
- Store validation performance to measure influence of each building block

### Performance Measurement
- Track incremental improvements from single-agent to block-optimized performance
- Measure influence of each building block: Iₐᵢ = E(a*ᵢ) / E(a*₀)
- Establish performance baselines for subsequent topology optimization

## Why This Matters

Block-level optimization addresses the fundamental challenge that prompt sensitivity in single agents becomes amplified when cascaded in multi-agent systems. By optimizing individual agents first, the framework prevents compounding effects from ill-formed agents with manual prompts.

## Performance Evidence

- Achieves 6% average performance gain over single-agent optimization
- Demonstrates superior token-effectiveness compared to scaling approaches
- Provides essential foundation for effective topology optimization in subsequent stages
- Prevents performance degradation from prompt sensitivity compounding

## Implementation Details

### Prompt Components Optimized
- **Role definition**: Agent's functional role (e.g., "You are an expert in reflecting on errors...")
- **Behavioral instructions**: Guidance for agent behavior (e.g., "You should think step by step...")
- **Few-shot demonstrations**: In-context examples to guide agent responses
- **Task-specific formatting**: Output format and structure requirements

### Technical Constraints
- Use modular prompt optimizer (e.g., MIPRO) for systematic optimization
- Limit demonstrations to manageable numbers (e.g., 3 bootstrapped examples)
- Constrain instruction candidates for computational efficiency (e.g., 10 candidates)
- Apply validation-based optimization over multiple rounds (e.g., 10 rounds)
