## Core Concept

MIPRO (Multi-turn Instruction and example PRompt Optimization) integration pattern uses Bayesian surrogate models to systematically optimize both instructions and few-shot demonstrations for individual agents within multi-agent systems, providing plug-and-play prompt optimization capabilities.

## Research Context

This integration pattern addresses the critical need for systematic prompt optimization in multi-agent systems where manual prompt crafting becomes computationally intractable and prompt sensitivity can compound across agent interactions.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Multi-Agent Design: Optimizing Agents with Better Prompts and Topologies (Google/Cambridge Research)
- **Credibility Score**: 9
- **Validation Method**: Peer-reviewed research with extensive empirical validation across 8 benchmark tasks

## Connection Potential

Links to block-level prompt optimization, automatic prompt engineering frameworks, multi-agent system search methodology, and Bayesian optimization techniques for AI systems.

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Specifications
- **Optimization Components**: Joint optimization of instructions and demonstrations
- **Surrogate Model**: Bayesian surrogate model for efficient search
- **Demonstration Limit**: 3 bootstrapped demonstrations per agent
- **Instruction Candidates**: 10 candidates per optimization round
- **Optimization Rounds**: 10 rounds for systematic exploration
- **Temperature Setting**: T=0.7 for generation diversity

### Integration Protocol
1. **Bootstrap Demonstrations**: Generate examples from model's correct predictions on validation set
2. **Instruction Generation**: Propose instruction candidates with dataset summary and diversity hints
3. **Joint Optimization**: Simultaneous refinement of instructions and demonstrations
4. **Validation Scoring**: Use validation metrics to guide Bayesian surrogate model
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple rounds of optimization for convergence

### Performance Characteristics
- **Token-Effectiveness**: Superior to scaling approaches (self-consistency, self-refine)
- **Computational Efficiency**: Manageable budget through targeted optimization
- **Quality Improvements**: Significant gains over manually crafted prompts
- **Cascading Benefits**: Optimized agents prevent compounding sensitivity effects

### Multi-Agent Specific Adaptations
- **Block-Level Focus**: Optimize individual agents before composition
- **Conditioning Strategy**: Condition topology optimization on optimized base predictor
- **Minimum Configuration**: Optimize minimal topology building blocks first
- **Influence Measurement**: Store validation performance for topology selection

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Extracted from Google/Cambridge MASS framework research as distinct implementation pattern
- **Future**: Track integration patterns across different prompt optimization frameworks and multi-agent architectures
