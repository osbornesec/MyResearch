## Core Concept

LLM editing systems face fundamental scalability challenges including context window limitations for large documents, computational overhead for multi-file edits, upper limits on simultaneous edit operations, and diff computation complexity that requires strategic decomposition for enterprise-scale codebases.

## Research Context

Essential for engineering teams planning LLM editing tool deployment at scale. Enables realistic expectation setting and architecture planning for large codebase management.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Systematic analysis of LLM editing system limitations across multiple tools
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10
- **Validation Method**: Comparative analysis and identified research gaps in large-scale deployment

## Implementation Notes

**Primary Scalability Limitations**:

**Context Window Constraints**:
- Large documents exceed model context limits
- Multi-file edits compound token usage exponentially
- Requires strategic document chunking and context management

**Computational Overhead**:
- Diff computation complexity increases with file size (Void system)
- Real-time streaming becomes problematic for large changes
- Token processing costs scale non-linearly with edit complexity

**Edit Operation Limits**:
- Unknown upper bound on simultaneous edits per LLM pass
- Complex multi-location changes require careful orchestration
- Cross-file dependency resolution challenges

**Architectural Approaches for Scale**:
- Hybrid editing: Combine targeted edits with full file regeneration
- Hierarchical decomposition: Break large edits into manageable chunks
- Strategic verification: Apply quality gates appropriate to edit complexity

**Open Research Questions**:
- Optimal edit batch sizes for different model architectures
- Effectiveness of few-shot prompting vs fine-tuning for large-scale edits
- Multi-file edit orchestration patterns and dependency management
