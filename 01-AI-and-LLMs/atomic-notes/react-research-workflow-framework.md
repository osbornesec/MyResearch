# ReAct Research Workflow Framework

## Core Concept

A dynamic research methodology combining explicit reasoning with strategic actions in iterative cycles, enabling adaptive information gathering and progressive refinement based on intermediate findings and observations.

## Operational Cycle

### Four-Phase Process
1. **Reason**: Generate thoughts about current problem state, analyze available information, plan next steps
2. **Act**: Perform specific action based on reasoning (search, retrieve, analyze, synthesize)
3. **Observe**: Process and evaluate results of the action
4. **Reflect**: Integrate observations into understanding and plan next cycle

### Implementation Pattern
```
[Reason] → Assess information needs and strategic direction
[Act] → Execute targeted information gathering or analysis
[Observe] → Record and evaluate action outcomes  
[Reflect] → Update understanding and determine next iteration
```

## Research Applications

**Literature Reviews**: Systematic exploration and synthesis across multiple databases and source types

**Multi-Source Verification**: Cross-checking facts and claims through progressive investigation

**Complex Investigation Management**: Maintaining coherent research narratives while exploring multiple avenues

**Hypothesis Development**: Refining research questions based on iterative evidence gathering

## Advanced Implementation Strategies

### Explicit Research Planning
- **Structured Research Plans**: Pre-defined reasoning-action sequences with decision points
- **Multi-Tool Integration**: Strategic use of different tools for specific action types
- **Critical Path Identification**: Focus on crucial unknowns early in the process

### Reflection and Adaptation
- **Periodic Assessment**: Step back to evaluate overall research progress
- **Direction Pivoting**: Adjust focus based on emerging insights
- **Quality Checkpoints**: Verify reasoning chains and evidence quality

## Methodological Advantages

**Transparent Process**: Explicit reasoning steps create traceable research chains

**Adaptive Strategy**: Dynamic adjustment based on intermediate findings

**Information Integration**: Natural accommodation of diverse sources and formats

**Strategic Efficiency**: Targeted actions based on reasoned assessment of needs
