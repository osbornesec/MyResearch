# Chain-of-Thought Algorithmic Decomposition

## Core Concept

Chain-of-thought prompting for complex algorithms uses structured 6-step decomposition (problem analysis, algorithm design, implementation planning, code implementation, testing strategy, optimization) to achieve 60-80% improvement in algorithmic problem-solving accuracy.

## Research Context

This structured approach significantly enhances LLMs' ability to tackle multi-step algorithmic solutions by explicitly guiding the reasoning process through logical progression from high-level design to implementation details.

## Source Quality
