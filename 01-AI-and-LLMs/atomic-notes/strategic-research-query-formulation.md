# Strategic Research Query Formulation

## Core Concept

Advanced prompt engineering methodology specifically designed for research contexts that maximizes AI output quality through precise language, strategic specificity, iterative refinement, and sophisticated framing techniques.

## Foundational Principles

### Clarity and Specificity Framework
- **Explicit Research Goals**: Clear articulation of exploratory vs. analytical vs. evaluative intent
- **Scope Parameter Definition**: Precise boundaries including time periods, methodological requirements, and focus areas
- **Context Provision**: Background information that guides AI perspective and understanding
- **Output Format Specification**: Detailed structure requirements and depth expectations

### Iterative Refinement Strategy
```
Broad Initial Query → Focused Follow-up → Gap-Based Refinement → Progressive Enhancement
```

**Dynamic Dialogue Approach**:
- Start broad to establish landscape, then narrow to specific aspects
- Use AI outputs to inform subsequent queries
- Refine based on identified gaps or limitations
- Progressively increase specificity and analytical depth

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Role Prompting for Research Excellence
- **Domain Expert Roles**: Specialized knowledge perspective assignment
- **Methodological Expert Roles**: Research design and analysis focus
- **Critical Analysis Roles**: Skeptical evaluation and limitation identification
- **Interdisciplinary Bridge Roles**: Cross-domain integration and synthesis

### Step-Back Prompting for Foundational Understanding
- **Two-Stage Framework**: Establish principles first, then apply to specifics
- **Theoretical Grounding**: Foundational concepts before detailed analysis
- **Methodological Foundation**: Research design principles before evaluation
- **Error Reduction**: Minimize reasoning errors through principled approach

### Chain-of-Thought Integration
- **Explicit Reasoning Requests**: Show analytical step progression
- **Structured Analytical Frameworks**: Multi-step systematic evaluation
- **Evidence Evaluation Chains**: Systematic assessment of claim support
- **Transparent Logic**: Traceable reasoning for verification and refinement

## Implementation Examples

### Research Goal Specification
```
"Analyze smartphone impact on adolescent mental health, focusing on:
- Studies published 2018-2023
- Methodologically rigorous longitudinal research  
- Differentiated effects by usage type
- Demonstrated mechanisms rather than correlations"
```

### Context-Rich Framing
```
"Context: Public health researcher preparing intervention grant
Need: Current evidence base on smartphone effects
Focus: Usage type distinctions and causal mechanisms
Output: Structured analysis with methodology overview, key findings, 
identified mechanisms, literature gaps, intervention implications"
```

## Quality Assurance Elements

**Progressive Enhancement**: Each iteration builds analytical depth and precision

**Multiple Perspective Integration**: Role prompting enables diverse analytical approaches

**Verification Support**: Chain-of-thought enables reasoning validation

**Strategic Efficiency**: Targeted queries reduce unnecessary iteration cycles
