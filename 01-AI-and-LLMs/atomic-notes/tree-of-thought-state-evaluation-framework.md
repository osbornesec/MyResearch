# Tree-of-Thought State Evaluation Framework

## Core Concept
State evaluation is the systematic scoring mechanism that determines which thought branches to pursue, prune, or abandon during ToT exploration. The framework employs multi-criteria assessment across five dimensions: correctness (logic soundness, edge case handling), efficiency (time/space complexity), maintainability (code readability, structure quality), security (vulnerability assessment, input validation), and implementability (development feasibility, resource requirements). Each criterion receives weighted scores (1-10) with confidence levels and specific justifications.

## Research Context
Effective state evaluation directly correlates with ToT success rates in complex reasoning tasks. Research demonstrates that systematic multi-criteria evaluation prevents the greedy search problems that limit Chain-of-Thought approaches, enabling the 74% vs 4% performance differential in mathematical reasoning tasks and 40-60% improvement in programming applications.

## Implementation Details

### Core Evaluation Criteria

**Correctness Assessment (Weight: High)**
- Logic soundness validation (1-10 scale)
- Edge case handling completeness
- Algorithm correctness verification
- Input validation adequacy
- Expected output: proceed/modify/abandon recommendation

**Efficiency Analysis (Weight: High)**
- Time complexity evaluation (Big O notation)
- Space complexity assessment 
- Scalability projections
- Resource utilization optimization
- Performance bottleneck identification

**Maintainability Scoring (Weight: Medium)**
- Code readability assessment
- Structural quality evaluation
- Documentation adequacy
- Test coverage implications
- Technical debt considerations

**Security Evaluation (Weight: High)**
- Vulnerability scanning
- Input sanitization validation
- Data exposure risk assessment
- Authentication/authorization impacts
- Error handling security implications

**Implementability Rating (Weight: Medium)**
- Development complexity (1-10 scale)
- Required expertise assessment
- Timeline feasibility
- Resource availability
- Dependency management

### Weighted Scoring Algorithm
```
overall_score = (correctness * 0.3 + efficiency * 0.25 + maintainability * 0.2 + security * 0.15 + implementability * 0.1)
confidence_level = min(individual_confidence_scores)
recommendation = threshold_based_decision(overall_score, confidence_level)
```
