# Tool Coordination Patterns for Specialized Agent Swarms

## Core Concept

MCP tool coordination creates specialized agent swarms through defined role mapping where Sequential Thinking serves as master orchestrator, Perplexity as research specialist, Context7 as knowledge manager, Supabase as state coordinator, Puppeteer as web automation agent, and TaskMaster as project orchestrator, enabling complex multi-phase workflows through host-mediated coordination and shared state management.

## Research Context

This establishes the foundation for practical swarm implementation using existing MCP tools, demonstrating how current capabilities can be orchestrated into intelligent agent networks while revealing coordination patterns that inform custom MCP development priorities.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: MCP Swarm Intelligence Orchestration Analysis 2025, Section 2.1-2.2
- **Credibility Score**: 8
- **Validation Method**: Mapped against actual MCP tool capabilities and coordination requirements

## Connection Potential

- Links to multi-agent workflow orchestration and task distribution frameworks
- Connects to agent role specialization and capability mapping patterns
- Relates to parallel processing coordination and dependency management
- Foundation for advanced swarm coordination engine development

## Implementation Notes

Coordination patterns include parallel research phases (Perplexity + Context7), sequential validation workflows (research → analysis → synthesis), and event-driven task distribution through TaskMaster. State coordination via Supabase enables cross-agent data sharing while Sequential Thinking provides structured reasoning for complex decision coordination.

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Created from Smart Extraction of tool coordination analysis
- **Future**: Needs connection to specific workflow templates and performance optimization patterns
