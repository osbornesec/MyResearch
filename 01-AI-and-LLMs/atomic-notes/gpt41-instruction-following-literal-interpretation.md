# GPT-4.1 Instruction Following Literal Interpretation

## Core Concept
GPT-4.1 follows instructions more closely and literally than predecessors, requiring explicit specification rather than implicit intent inference. This enhanced instruction adherence enables precise behavioral control but may require prompt migration from previous models that relied on liberal intent interpretation.

## Behavioral Changes
- **Literal Adherence**: Model follows explicit instructions more precisely than GPT-4o
- **Reduced Inference**: Less liberal interpretation of implied user intent
- **High Steerability**: Single sentence clarification usually sufficient for behavioral correction
- **Prompt Migration Need**: Existing prompts may require updates for optimal performance

## Implementation Requirements
- **Explicit Specification**: Must clearly state desired behaviors rather than assuming inference
- **Conflict Resolution**: Conflicting instructions favor those closer to end of prompt
- **Rule Hierarchy**: Specific instructions override general guidance
- **Example Alignment**: Sample behaviors must match stated rules

## Common Failure Patterns
- **Over-adherence**: "Must call tool" can induce hallucinated inputs without sufficient information
- **Verbatim Repetition**: Sample phrases used exactly as provided without variation
- **Excessive Prose**: Additional explanatory text without specific formatting instructions

## Research Context
Critical for developing effective prompting strategies that leverage GPT-4.1's enhanced instruction-following capabilities.

## Source Quality
