# Step-Back Prompting Abstraction Technique

## Core Concept
Step-Back prompting instructs models to first extract high-level concepts and principles from given details, then use those concepts to guide reasoning toward solutions. This two-step process involves prompting for abstraction followed by utilizing abstracted knowledge, representing a meta-level iteration that steps back from immediate problems to consider broader principles.

## Research Context
This technique helps models avoid getting lost in irrelevant details by grounding reasoning in relevant principles. For example, when faced with a physics problem, step-back prompting would first identify the relevant physical law before attempting to solve the specific problem.
