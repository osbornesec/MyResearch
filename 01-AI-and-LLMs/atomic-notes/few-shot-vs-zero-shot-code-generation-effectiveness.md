# Few-Shot vs Zero-Shot Code Generation Effectiveness

## Core Concept

Few-shot prompting with code examples consistently outperforms zero-shot approaches for AI code generation, achieving 28.3 percentage point improvement in code quality with Pass@k scores of 85-92% versus 65-75% for zero-shot methods.

## Research Context

This finding establishes the fundamental importance of providing concrete examples in coding prompts, directly impacting code correctness, security vulnerability rates (50% reduction), and human evaluation ratings (4.2/5.0 vs 3.1/5.0).

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: MSR 2025 Conference empirical assessment of LLMs for code
- **Credibility Score**: 8
- **Validation Method**: Controlled empirical study with quantitative metrics

## Connection Potential

Links to existing concepts: adaptive-prompting-systems, structured-prompting-templates, code-context-optimization, security-focused-prompt-engineering patterns.

## Implementation Notes

Best practices include: 2-3 relevant examples showing desired patterns, comprehensive docstrings and type hints, proper error handling demonstration, and edge case management examples. Examples should be directly relevant to the target task domain.

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Created from foundational prompt engineering research extraction
- **Future**: Monitor for updated effectiveness metrics and new comparison studies
