## Core Concept

Claude Code Enterprise requires $60/seat monthly with 70-seat minimum commitment ($50,400 annually), delivering 2.3x productivity gains and under 1-month payback periods when factoring reduced technical debt and accelerated time-to-market.

## Research Context

Critical for enterprise adoption planning and budget allocation decisions. Enables accurate TCO modeling and ROI projection for organizations evaluating AI coding assistant implementations.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Official Anthropic pricing documentation + third-party enterprise analysis
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Multi-source verification through Perplexity research and official documentation

## Implementation Notes

**Budget Planning Framework**:
```math
Budget = (Seats × $60) + (Developers × Avg_Tokens × Cost_Per_MTok) + API_Integration_Costs
```

**Cost Optimization Strategies**:
- Prompt caching: 78-89% reduction for document-heavy workflows
- Model selection: Sonnet 4 vs Opus 4 yields 80% savings for routine tasks
- Token efficiency: `/compact` command reduces consumption 40%
