# Emergent Collective Intelligence

## Core Concept

System-level intelligence that emerges from simple interaction rules between autonomous agents, creating capabilities that exceed the sum of individual agent contributions. Unlike orchestrated workflows where behavior is predetermined, emergent systems develop novel problem-solving approaches through distributed decision-making and adaptive coordination patterns that arise spontaneously from agent interactions.

## Research Context

Fundamental differentiator between true swarm intelligence and workflow orchestration systems. Most existing AI agent frameworks implement predetermined coordination patterns, while emergent systems enable breakthrough solutions through unprogrammed collective behavior. Represents paradigm shift from designed coordination to evolved coordination.
