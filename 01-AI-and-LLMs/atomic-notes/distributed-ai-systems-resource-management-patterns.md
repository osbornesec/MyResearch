# Distributed AI Systems Resource Management Patterns

## Core Concept

Distributed AI systems require dynamic resource allocation with intelligent load balancing targeting 70-85% CPU utilization, 80-90% memory usage with 20% safety buffer, 85-95% API rate utilization with burst capacity, and sub-100ms coordination latency through memory pooling, auto-scaling, and circuit breaker patterns.

## Research Context

Essential architectural patterns for scaling AI agent systems beyond single-node limitations. Provides framework for resource optimization, fault tolerance, and performance management in multi-agent distributed environments.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Claude Code Swarm Intelligence Performance Analysis 2025 by Dr. Lisa Wang
