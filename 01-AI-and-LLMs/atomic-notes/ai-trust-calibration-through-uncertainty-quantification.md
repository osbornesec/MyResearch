# AI Trust Calibration Through Uncertainty Quantification

## Core Concept
Trust calibration in AI coding systems requires sophisticated uncertainty quantification methods that accurately communicate AI reliability to developers through multiple indicators and human-AI collaboration models.

## Research Context
Developer trust in AI-generated code is critical for adoption and effective collaboration. Poor trust calibration leads to over-reliance or under-utilization of AI assistance.

## Key Components
1. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Combining entropy-based and probability differential methods
2. **Reliability Indicators**: Syntactic correctness, semantic consistency, performance predictions
3. **Human-AI Collaboration Models**: Transparent communication of AI capabilities and limitations

## Uncertainty Types
- **Epistemic Uncertainty**: Model knowledge limitations
- **Aleatoric Uncertainty**: Inherent problem complexity

## Implementation Requirements
- Continuous monitoring and feedback mechanisms
- Dynamic trust adjustment based on observed performance
- Hierarchical task analysis for optimal human intervention points
- Interactive feedback mechanisms

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Advanced Explainable AI Coding Systems framework
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10
- **Validation Method**: Cross-referenced with uncertainty quantification research

## Connection Potential
- Links to human-computer interaction design
- Connects to AI reliability assessment
- Relates to developer experience optimization
- Bridges to software quality assurance
