# Swarm Coordination Performance Bottlenecks

## Core Concept

Swarm coordination bottlenecks manifest as communication overhead scaling from <1% for 10 agents to 15-25% for 500-1000 agents, resolved through message batching (70-85% overhead reduction), async communication patterns (3-5x responsiveness improvement), and priority routing (90% critical message latency reduction).

## Research Context

Critical performance limitation in multi-agent systems where coordination overhead becomes dominant constraint. Understanding bottlenecks enables optimization strategies for maintaining efficiency at scale while preserving coordination effectiveness.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Claude Code Swarm Intelligence Performance Analysis 2025 by Dr. Lisa Wang
- **Credibility Score**: 8
- **Validation Method**: Performance profiling and coordination overhead measurement across different agent scales

## Connection Potential

Links to concurrent agent execution scalability, distributed AI systems resource management, message queue optimization, inter-agent communication patterns, and fault tolerance mechanisms.

## Implementation Notes

Optimization techniques include: async message queues with priority routing, message compression for 40-60% bandwidth savings, batch delivery mechanisms, and cache layers for frequently accessed coordination data.
