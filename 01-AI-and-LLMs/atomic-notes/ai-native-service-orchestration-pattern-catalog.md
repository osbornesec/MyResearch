# AI-Native Service Orchestration Pattern Catalog

## Core Concept
AI-native service orchestration patterns include Intelligent Service Mesh, AI Agent Swarm, Contextual AI Router, and Federated AI Pipeline - four fundamental patterns that treat artificial intelligence as first-class citizens in system architecture design.

## Research Context
Traditional software architectures add AI as an afterthought, while AI-native systems embed intelligence at every layer. These orchestration patterns enable dynamic, intelligent coordination of AI services.

## Four Core Patterns
1. **Intelligent Service Mesh**: Routes requests based on model performance, resource availability, and prediction confidence
2. **AI Agent Swarm**: Coordinates specialized AI agents through standardized protocols for collaborative problem-solving
3. **Contextual AI Router**: Selects optimal AI models based on contextual information and task requirements
4. **Federated AI Pipeline**: Enables distributed AI processing across organizations while maintaining privacy

## Technical Implementation
- Performance-based traffic routing with SLA maintenance
- Autonomous agent discovery and communication protocols
- Intelligent model selection through context analysis
- Privacy-preserving distributed AI processing without data centralization

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Comprehensive Framework for AI-Native Software Architecture Patterns
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10
- **Validation Method**: Cross-referenced with current service mesh and distributed AI research

## Connection Potential
- Links to microservices architecture patterns
- Connects to distributed systems coordination
- Relates to AI model lifecycle management
- Bridges to privacy-preserving AI techniques
