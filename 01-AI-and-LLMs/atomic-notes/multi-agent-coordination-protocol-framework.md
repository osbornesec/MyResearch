# Distributed AI Team Coordination Protocols

## Core Concept
Multi-agent coordination protocols enable distributed AI development teams through three primary approaches: centralized (global optimization), distributed (scalable peer-to-peer), and hybrid coordination mechanisms.

## Research Context
Modern software development increasingly relies on distributed AI agents working collaboratively on complex projects, requiring sophisticated coordination frameworks to maintain productivity and system coherence.

## Coordination Strategies
1. **Centralized Coordination**: Single controller maintaining complete system information for deterministic behavior
2. **Distributed Coordination**: Peer-to-peer interactions dispersing decision-making authority for scalability
3. **Hybrid Coordination**: Combining centralized oversight with distributed execution for optimal balance

## Technical Implementation
- Contract net protocol for task allocation across specialized agents
- Multistage negotiation protocols for resource allocation under constraints
- Hierarchical coordination for scaling beyond small teams (10+ agents)
- Event-driven architectures reducing communication overhead

## Agent Specialization Examples
- **Composer**: Architectural vision and system design
- **Conductor**: Task conversion and workflow management
- **Performer**: Code execution and implementation
- **Checker**: Quality assurance and validation
- **Security Specialist**: Threat modeling and security analysis

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Advanced Coordination Mechanisms for Distributed AI Development Teams
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10
- **Validation Method**: Cross-referenced with multi-agent systems and distributed coordination research
