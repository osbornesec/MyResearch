# SHARED Model Schema Integration Framework

## Core Concept

The SHARED model (Schema-Hippocampus Assimilation and Reconsolidation-Dependent Encoding) explains how schema-congruent memories rapidly integrate into neocortical networks via vmPFC-hippocampal dialogue, while schema-incongruent memories require prolonged hippocampal dependency for integration.

## Research Context

Provides computational framework for understanding how prior knowledge accelerates memory consolidation and learning. Critical for designing PKM systems that leverage existing knowledge structures for more efficient new information integration.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Cognitive Science PKM Research 2024 (Network Effects section)
- **Credibility Score**: 9
- **Validation Method**: Computational model validated through resting-state fMRI studies

## Connection Potential

Links to schema theory, knowledge graph design, hierarchical learning systems, transfer learning, and adaptive knowledge organization algorithms.

## Implementation Notes

- Design knowledge organization to reflect natural schema structures
- Facilitate schema-congruent information for faster integration
- Provide additional support for schema-incongruent novel information
- Use vmPFC-inspired integration pathways for familiar content
- Implement hippocampal-style processing for novel content

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Extracted from cognitive science research on schema formation
- **Future**: Develop PKM algorithms based on SHARED model principles for intelligent knowledge integration
