# GPT-4.1 Diff Generation V4A Format

## Core Concept
GPT-4.1 features substantially improved diff capabilities using a custom V4A format that avoids line numbers and provides both exact code to replace and replacement code with clear delimiters. The format uses context-based identification rather than line numbers for more robust code modification.

## V4A Format Structure
```
*** [ACTION] File: [path/to/file] -> ACTION: Add, Update, or Delete
[context_before] -> 3 lines above change
- [old_code] -> Minus sign precedes old code
+ [new_code] -> Plus sign precedes new code  
[context_after] -> 3 lines below change
```

## Context Identification Rules
- **Default Context**: 3 lines immediately above and below each change
- **Unique Identification**: Use @@ operator for class/function context when needed
- **Multiple Context Levels**: Stack @@ statements for deeply nested contexts
- **No Line Numbers**: Context sufficient for unique code identification

## Alternative Effective Formats
- **SEARCH/REPLACE**: Used in Aider's polyglot benchmark with high success rates
- **Pseudo-XML**: Clear delimiters with no internal escaping requirements
- **Common Principles**: No line numbers + exact code specification + clear delimiters

## Performance Advantages
- **Robust Identification**: Context-based rather than fragile line number dependency
- **Training Optimization**: Extensively trained on V4A format for improved accuracy
- **Maintainability**: Changes survive code modifications better than line-based approaches

## Research Context
Essential for developing accurate code modification systems and automated refactoring tools.
