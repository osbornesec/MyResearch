# Mermaid Syntax AI Parsing Mechanisms

## Core Concept
AI systems process Mermaid diagrams through a three-stage pipeline: tokenization (breaking text into meaningful components), grammar recognition (understanding Mermaid syntax rules), and structural parsing (converting flat text into hierarchical representations with node relationships and edge semantics).

## Technical Implementation
Modern LLMs use the @mermaid-js/parser package approach:
```javascript
const { parse } = require('@mermaid-js/parser');
const ast = parse('flowchart', 'A-->B');
```

The tokenization layer identifies keywords (flowchart, LR), node identifiers (A, B), operators (-->), and content within brackets/braces, treating Mermaid as a domain-specific language rather than natural language.

## Research Evidence
AI systems achieve 85-95% accuracy for standard Mermaid patterns but struggle with:
- Context-dependent semantics (same label meaning different things across domains)
- Implicit relationships not encoded in syntax
- Visual layout semantic meaning that pure text processing misses
