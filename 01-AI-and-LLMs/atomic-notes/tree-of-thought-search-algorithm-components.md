# Tree-of-Thought Search Algorithm Components

## Core Concept
Tree-of-Thought (ToT) implementation requires systematic exploration strategies that determine how the AI navigates through the branching solution space. Three fundamental search algorithms form the backbone of ToT reasoning: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Beam Search, each optimized for different problem characteristics and computational constraints.

## Research Context
Search algorithm selection critically impacts ToT performance in AI coding applications. BFS excels at finding optimal solutions with sufficient computational resources, DFS works well for deep problem spaces with clear success criteria, and Beam Search provides the optimal balance of exploration breadth and computational efficiency for production systems.

## Implementation Details

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Strategy**: Explore all possibilities at each level before proceeding deeper
- **Best For**: Finding optimal solutions when computational resources allow
- **Parameters**: max_depth=4, beam_width=3 (typical settings)
- **Advantage**: Guarantees shortest path to solution
- **Disadvantage**: Exponential memory growth with branching factor

### Depth-First Search (DFS)  
- **Strategy**: Pursue single paths to completion before backtracking
- **Best For**: Deep problem spaces with clear termination criteria
- **Memory Efficiency**: O(depth) instead of O(breadth^depth)
- **Risk**: May miss optimal solutions due to early path commitment

### Beam Search
- **Strategy**: Maintain top-k candidates at each level (k=beam_width)
- **Production Standard**: Most commonly used in real applications
- **Balances**: Exploration breadth vs computational cost
- **Typical Configuration**: beam_width=3-5, max_depth=4-6
