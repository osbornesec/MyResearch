# Chain of Thought Intermediate Reasoning Steps

## Core Concept
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables complex reasoning capabilities through intermediate reasoning steps, making the model's thought process explicit and traceable. CoT inherently embodies iterative refinement by breaking down complex reasoning into discrete steps that build on each other.

## Research Context
CoT serves as the foundation for many advanced prompt engineering techniques and significantly improves performance on complex reasoning tasks. It can be implemented as zero-shot ("Let's think step by step") or few-shot with examples.
