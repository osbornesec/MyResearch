## Core Concept

Comparative analysis of deep research AI tools reveals Gemini-2.5-DR as optimal for task adherence and accuracy (follows prompts closely, provides accurate SDK code, flags uncertainties), while o3-DR produces high volume but unreliable content with invented specifications, and Sonnet-3.7-DR offers production-ready code patterns despite brevity.

## Research Context

Critical for researchers and developers selecting AI tools for comprehensive research tasks. Enables evidence-based tool selection and understanding of each system's strengths and limitations.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Direct comparative evaluation across task-following, detail depth, and accuracy metrics
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10
- **Validation Method**: Side-by-side analysis with specific examples of accuracy and factual errors

## Implementation Notes

**Tool Performance Comparison**:

**Gemini-2.5-DR (Recommended Primary)**:
- Superior task adherence and prompt following
- Accurate SDK code examples with proper documentation
- Explicitly flags uncertainties and knowledge gaps
- Dedicated sections for known issues and limitations
- Processing time: 9 minutes

**o3-DR (Use with Caution)**:
- Highest volume output (~2x longer than others)
- Significant accuracy issues: invents model names, incorrect pricing
- Creates fictional specifications not corroborated by documentation
- Processing time: 12 minutes
- Good for inspiration but requires fact-checking

**Sonnet-3.7-DR (Code Pattern Source)**:
- Most concise but production-ready code patterns
- Unified provider interfaces and retry/result helpers
- Light coverage but high quality implementation examples
- Processing time: 54 minutes

**Key Evaluation Criteria**:
- Task-following accuracy and prompt adherence
- Factual accuracy vs invented specifications
- Code example quality and SDK correctness
- Coverage completeness and depth
- Uncertainty acknowledgment and limitation flagging
