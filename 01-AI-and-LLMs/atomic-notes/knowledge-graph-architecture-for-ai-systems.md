# Knowledge Graph Architecture for AI Systems

## Core Concept

Structured knowledge representation architecture that maps software development entities, relationships, and constraints into graph-based representations enabling automated reasoning, planning, and decision support through formal ontologies and neural graph processing.

## Graph Construction Framework

### Entity-Relationship Mapping
Knowledge graphs structure software development data:
- **Nodes**: Entities (files, functions, developers, issues, requirements)
- **Edges**: Relationships (calls, modifies, assigned_to, depends_on)
- **Attributes**: Properties (complexity, priority, timestamp, skill_level)

### Schema Integration Pattern
```json
{
  "entity_types": ["Component", "Developer", "Requirement"],
  "relation_types": ["implements", "depends_on", "assigned_to"],
  "constraints": {
    "implements": {"domain": "Developer", "range": "Component"},
    "depends_on": {"domain": "Component", "range": "Component"}
  }
}
```

## Ontological Frameworks

### OWL-Based Formal Representations
Web Ontology Language provides description logic foundations:
```owl
Class: SoftwareComponent
  SubClassOf: hasRequirement some Requirement
  SubClassOf: implementedBy some Developer
  SubClassOf: testedBy some TestCase

ObjectProperty: dependsOn
  Domain: SoftwareComponent
  Range: SoftwareComponent
  Characteristics: Transitive, Irreflexive
```

### Software Development Ontologies
Formal capture of engineering concepts:
- **Entities**: Projects, components, developers, requirements, defects
- **Relations**: depends_on, implements, tests, refactors
- **Constraints**: skill_requirements, deadline_precedence, resource_limits

## Neural Graph Processing

### Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
Learn distributed representations from software knowledge graphs:
```
h_v^(l+1) = UPDATE(h_v^l, AGGREGATE({h_u^l : u âˆˆ N(v)}))
```

### AI System Applications
- **Code Recommendation**: Graph embedding similarity for suggestion systems
- **Bug Prediction**: Anomaly detection in software call graphs
- **Dependency Optimization**: Graph neural planning for architecture decisions
- **Knowledge Discovery**: Pattern recognition across project knowledge graphs

## Unified Schema Design

Cross-project knowledge integration through standardized schemas enabling:
- **Multi-Project Learning**: Transfer insights across software domains
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring architectural and process patterns
- **Automated Reasoning**: Formal inference over software engineering knowledge
- **Decision Support**: Data-driven planning and resource allocation
