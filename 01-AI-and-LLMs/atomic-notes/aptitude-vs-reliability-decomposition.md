# Aptitude vs Reliability Decomposition in Conversational AI

## Core Concept

LLM performance degradation in multi-turn conversations decomposes into two distinct components: aptitude (90th percentile performance representing best-case capability) and reliability (inter-percentile range between 90th and 10th percentiles). Research shows aptitude degrades minimally (16% average) while unreliability more than doubles (112% increase) in multi-turn settings.

## Research Context

This decomposition reveals that the "lost in conversation" phenomenon is primarily a reliability issue rather than a fundamental capability limitation. All tested models, regardless of single-turn performance, exhibit similarly high unreliability in multi-turn conversations, with 50+ percentage point gaps between best and worst performance on identical tasks.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: "LLMs Get Lost In Multi-Turn Conversation" - Section 6.2 Aptitude vs Reliability Analysis
- **Credibility Score**: 9
- **Validation Method**: Statistical analysis across 200,000+ conversations with repeated simulations (N=10 per instruction)

## Connection Potential

Links to stochastic process analysis, AI system reliability engineering, user experience consistency, and production AI deployment considerations. Connects to existing concepts around performance measurement and quality assurance in AI systems.

## Implementation Notes

Metrics defined as: Average Performance (P̄) = mean score, Aptitude (A⁹⁰) = 90th percentile score, Unreliability (U₁₀⁹⁰) = 90th - 10th percentile range. Single-turn settings show positive correlation between aptitude and reliability, but this correlation breaks down completely in multi-turn scenarios.
