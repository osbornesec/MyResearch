# Mental Model Alignment in Human-AI Coding Collaboration

## Core Concept
Shared understanding between developers and AI systems regarding task goals, problem-solving strategies, and error recovery patterns, where misalignments occur in 72% of business objectives, 64% of team coding conventions, and 58% of security constraints.

## Critical Alignment Dimensions
- **Task goals**: Explicit representation of project objectives and constraints
- **Problem-solving strategies**: Understanding of algorithmic approaches and architectural patterns
- **Error recovery patterns**: Shared protocols for handling failures and edge cases
- **Context awareness**: Knowledge of codebase maturity, team conventions, and domain-specific requirements

## Misalignment Manifestations
- AI lacks project-specific context leading to architecturally inconsistent suggestions
- Unfamiliar coding patterns that don't match team standards
- Failure to explain rationale behind complex algorithmic choices
- Security constraint violations due to incomplete context understanding

## Successful Alignment Implementations
IBM's AI Pair Engineer system demonstrates effective alignment through:
- Maintaining explicit goal stacks for shared objective tracking
- Visualizing decision boundaries for transparent reasoning
- Real-time flagging of paradigm mismatches between human and AI approaches

## Research Context
Essential for reducing the cognitive overhead of AI validation while maintaining code quality and architectural consistency in collaborative development environments.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Sources**: Empirical studies of AI coding tool usage patterns, system implementations
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Longitudinal analysis of human-AI collaboration effectiveness

## Connection Potential
Links to cognitive load theory, trust-but-verify paradigms, attention management strategies, and developer adaptation patterns.
