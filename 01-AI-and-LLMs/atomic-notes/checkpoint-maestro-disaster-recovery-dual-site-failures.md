# CheckPoint Maestro Disaster Recovery Dual-Site Failures

## Core Concept
CheckPoint Maestro implements comprehensive disaster recovery mechanisms for dual-site simultaneous failures through HyperSync state replication, hierarchical failover policies, and orchestrated recovery workflows that maintain business continuity during catastrophic outages.

## Dual-Site Architecture Components
- **Paired Orchestrators**: Geographically separated Maestro Hyperscale Orchestrators connected via Site-Sync VLANs
- **Active/Standby Sites**: Dynamic site assignment per Security Group (Site A active for SG-1, Site B active for SG-2)
- **HyperSync Replication**: Triple-redundant connection state backup (local active, local backup, remote backup)
- **Site-Sync Connectivity**: Dedicated VLAN requiring QinQ encapsulation and jumbo frame support

## Simultaneous Failure Scenarios
### Complete Site Loss
- **Cold Start Recovery**: Restoration from offline backups with manual policy reassignment
- **License Rehosting**: Manual IP address reassignment for Check Point licenses
- **SIC Certificate Reset**: Secure Internal Communication re-establishment
- **Recovery Time**: 8-12 minutes per appliance for complete site restoration

### Partial Dual-Site Failure
- **SGM-Level Failover**: Individual Security Group Member failure within both sites
- **Iterator Process**: Post-recovery algorithm redistributing connections through load simulation
- **Connection Persistence**: Surviving SGMs maintain sessions via HyperSync state preservation
- **Automatic Recovery**: Sub-second failover for surviving infrastructure

## Failover Decision Matrix
### Site Priority Mechanisms
- **Grade-Based Failover**: Failover occurs when alternative site grade exceeds current by threshold (default: 10 points)
- **Appliance Health Scoring**: Real-time CPU, memory, and interface metrics determine SGM promotion
- **Quality Metrics**: Configurable thresholds for latency, packet loss, and resource utilization
- **Hierarchical Policies**: Multi-tier decision framework preventing unnecessary failovers

### Split-Brain Prevention
- **Quorum-Based Site Locking**: Requires majority consensus via witness nodes for active status
- **VRRP Priority Cascading**: Virtual router strict hierarchies with preemption disabled
- **GARP Chunking**: Gratuitous ARP updates define master ownership boundaries during recovery
- **Partition Detection**: Network fragmentation monitoring and automated isolation

## Recovery Procedures
### Automated Recovery Workflow
1. **Failure Detection**: Sub-400 nanosecond HyperSync health monitoring
2. **State Preservation**: Triple-redundant connection backup activation
3. **Traffic Redirection**: Dynamic routing table updates and BGP convergence
4. **Resource Reallocation**: Iterator-based load distribution optimization
5. **Service Restoration**: Connection state replay from surviving replicas

### Manual Recovery Steps
1. **Site Assessment**: Validate infrastructure status and connectivity
2. **Orchestrator Recovery**: Hardware replacement and configuration restoration
3. **License Management**: IP address rehosting and certificate renewal
4. **Policy Synchronization**: Management server reconnection and rule distribution
5. **Validation Testing**: End-to-end connectivity and performance verification

## Critical Limitations
- **Synchronization Overhead**: 10% throughput penalty per SGM, 15-20% Site-Sync bandwidth consumption
- **Recovery Dependencies**: Orchestrator must be restored before Security Groups
- **License Binding**: Manual intervention required for IP address reassignment
- **Network Requirements**: VLAN encapsulation limits legacy infrastructure compatibility

## Business Continuity Metrics
- **Recovery Time Objective**: Sub-60 seconds for automated failover, 8-12 minutes for manual recovery
- **Recovery Point Objective**: Near-zero data loss through real-time state replication
- **Availability Target**: 99.999% uptime with proper dual-site configuration
- **Throughput Maintenance**: Continues threat prevention exceeding 1.5 Tbps during recovery
