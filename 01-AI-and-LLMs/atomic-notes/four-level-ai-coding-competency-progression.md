# Four-Level AI Coding Competency Progression

## Core Concept

A structured learning progression model defines four distinct stages for developing AI coding expertise: Fluency (basic AI tool use), Proficiency (effective prompting and evaluation), Expertise (system integration and mentoring), and Mastery (innovation and organizational leadership).

## Competency Levels

### Level 1 – Fluency
**Focus**: Basic AI tool integration
- Use AI tools for simple coding tasks
- Identify integration points in workflows
- Understand tool capabilities and limitations
- Basic prompt formulation

### Level 2 – Proficiency  
**Focus**: Effective AI collaboration
- Craft effective and context-aware prompts
- Evaluate AI output quality systematically
- Manage data limitations and privacy concerns
- Optimize AI tool configuration

### Level 3 – Expertise
**Focus**: System design and mentoring
- Integrate symbolic and ML methods effectively
- Design AI-enhanced development pipelines
- Mentor peers in AI tool adoption
- Lead technical AI implementation projects

### Level 4 – Mastery
**Focus**: Innovation and organizational leadership
- Innovate new AI-coding frameworks
- Lead organization-wide AI initiatives
- Shape AI development policies and standards
- Contribute to AI coding community advancement

## Assessment Framework

Each level includes specific competency indicators:
- **Technical Skills**: Measurable technical capabilities
- **Process Integration**: Workflow and methodology effectiveness
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Ability to teach and mentor others
- **Innovation Capacity**: Contribution to field advancement

## Implementation Guidelines

### Progressive Learning Path
1. **Foundation Building**: Master basic tool usage before advancing
2. **Skill Validation**: Regular assessment at each level
3. **Mentoring Integration**: Pair learners with next-level practitioners
4. **Project Application**: Real-world projects for competency demonstration

### Organizational Integration
- Map roles to competency levels
- Design training pathways for advancement
- Establish mentoring relationships
- Track progression and success metrics

## Research Context

Framework synthesized from UNESCO AI competency guidelines, AI Alliance Essential Competencies Guide, and empirical data from AI coding adoption studies. Validated through cross-industry competency assessment programs.
