# CheckPoint Maestro SIP ALG NAT Traversal Mechanisms

## Core Concept
CheckPoint Maestro's **SIP Application Layer Gateway (ALG) dynamically rewrites SDP payloads and manages ephemeral port allocation** to resolve NAT traversal challenges for Session Initiation Protocol communications, enabling transparent VoIP connectivity through network address translation.

## Technical Details
- **Dynamic Port Service**: `sip_dynamic_ports` automatically opens non-standard ports identified during SIP registration
- **SDP Payload Translation**: ALG modifies `c=` and `m=` lines in Session Description Protocol to reflect public IP:port combinations
- **Registration Binding Correction**: Rewrites REGISTER messages replacing private addresses with VIP addresses
- **TCP Session Preservation**: `Keep all connections` maintains SIP-TCP sessions through NAT during policy installations
- **Hairpinning Support**: Enables internal calls traversing NAT for same-network endpoints

## Research Context
This implementation addresses fundamental VoIP deployment challenges in enterprise environments where NAT is ubiquitous but SIP's embedded addressing creates connectivity failures.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Sources**: CheckPoint SIP configuration guides, VoIP ALG documentation
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official CheckPoint technical documentation with configuration examples
