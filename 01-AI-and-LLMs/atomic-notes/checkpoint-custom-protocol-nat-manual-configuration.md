# CheckPoint Custom Protocol NAT Manual Configuration Framework

## Core Concept
CheckPoint Maestro supports **granular manual NAT rules for non-standard protocols lacking ALGs**, enabling bidirectional translation, service remapping, and conditional NAT through CLI configuration, though requiring protocol specifications for accurate state machine implementation.

## Technical Details
- **Bidirectional Translation**: Simultaneous source/destination IP rewriting in single rules
- **Service Translation**: Port remapping (e.g., external 8080 â†’ internal 80)
- **Conditional NAT Rules**: Service-specific or dynamic object restrictions
- **ALG Development**: Custom fixup protocol hooks for proprietary protocol payload parsing
- **UDP Compliance**: Endpoint-independent mapping per RFC 4787 for predictable behavior
- **Limitations**: ALG development errors may cause session termination or security bypass

## Research Context
This capability enables organizations to deploy proprietary applications through CheckPoint NAT while maintaining security, though it requires significant protocol expertise and careful testing.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Sources**: CheckPoint NAT configuration guides, ALG development documentation
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10
- **Validation Method**: Official CheckPoint configuration examples and community implementation guides
