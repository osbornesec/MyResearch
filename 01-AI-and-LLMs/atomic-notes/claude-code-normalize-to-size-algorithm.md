# Claude Code normalizeToSize Algorithm

## Core Concept

Claude Code's normalizeToSize algorithm iteratively reduces object depth based on actual byte count to preserve maximum information within token or memory constraints, enabling intelligent data truncation that maintains essential context.

## Algorithm Mechanics

**Iterative Reduction Process**:
- Analyzes actual byte count of data structures
- Identifies less critical information through structural analysis
- Progressively removes lower-priority content while preserving essential context
- Maintains data coherence during truncation process
- Optimizes for maximum information density within constraints

## Research Context

This algorithm addresses a critical challenge in AI systems with context windows or memory limitations. Rather than arbitrary truncation, the normalizeToSize approach ensures that the most important information is preserved when dealing with large codebases or complex data structures.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Southbridge Research cleanroom analysis
