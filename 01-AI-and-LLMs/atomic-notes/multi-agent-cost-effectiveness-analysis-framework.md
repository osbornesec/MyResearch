## Core Concept

Multi-Agent Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Framework provides systematic methodology for comparing the token-effectiveness of prompt optimization versus agent scaling approaches, demonstrating superior efficiency of optimized prompts over traditional multi-agent scaling strategies.

## Research Context

This framework addresses the critical need to evaluate whether investment in prompt optimization provides better returns than simply scaling the number of agents in multi-agent systems, particularly important for production deployments with computational budget constraints.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Multi-Agent Design: Optimizing Agents with Better Prompts and Topologies (Google/Cambridge Research)
- **Credibility Score**: 9
- **Validation Method**: Empirical comparison across multiple benchmarks with controlled token budgets

## Connection Potential

Links to performance evaluation frameworks, computational efficiency optimization, multi-agent system design principles, and resource allocation strategies for AI systems.

## Implementation Notes

### Analysis Methodology
- **Token Counting**: Total inference token cost as primary efficiency metric
- **Baseline Comparison**: Compare against self-consistency, self-refine, and multi-agent debate
- **Fair Comparison**: Limit maximum number of agents to 10 across all approaches
- **Performance Scaling**: Analyze accuracy improvements relative to token consumption

### Evaluation Framework
1. **Single Agent APO**: Establish optimized single-agent baseline with instruction and 1-shot exemplar optimization
2. **Scaling Approaches**: Measure token costs for self-consistency, reflection, and debate scaling
3. **Combined Optimization**: Apply self-consistency on top of prompt-optimized agents
4. **Trajectory Analysis**: Track optimization progress over computational budget

### Key Findings
- **Prompt Optimization Advantage**: Demonstrates significant token-effectiveness over agent scaling
- **Scaling Enhancement**: Self-consistency on optimized agents shows improved scaling performance
- **Saturation Points**: Standard scaling approaches saturate much earlier than optimized approaches
- **Multiplicative Benefits**: Optimization and scaling effects combine multiplicatively rather than additively

### Performance Metrics
- **Token-Effectiveness Ratio**: Performance improvement per token consumed
- **Optimization Trajectory**: Steady improvement vs high variance in baseline approaches  
- **Saturation Analysis**: Point at which additional tokens provide diminishing returns
- **Cross-Domain Validation**: Consistent benefits across reasoning, long-context, and coding tasks

### Comparative Results
- **MASS vs ADAS**: MASS shows steady optimization trajectory while ADAS gets trapped in over-complex topologies
- **MASS vs AFlow**: MASS demonstrates lower variance and more consistent improvements
- **Token Budget Analysis**: Better allocation of limited computational resources through focused optimization

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Extracted from MASS framework research as distinct evaluation methodology
- **Future**: Extend to other multi-agent optimization approaches and cost models beyond token counting
