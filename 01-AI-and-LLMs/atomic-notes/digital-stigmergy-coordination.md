# Digital Stigmergy Coordination

## Core Concept

Indirect coordination mechanism where AI agents communicate through environmental modifications rather than direct messages, using shared knowledge bases as "digital pheromones" that guide agent decisions. Successful task patterns are reinforced through shared memory accumulation, enabling coordination without central control or explicit agent-to-agent communication protocols.

## Research Context

Key mechanism enabling true swarm intelligence in AI systems by mimicking biological coordination patterns. Differs from existing multi-agent communication which relies on explicit message passing. Enables emergent collective behavior and self-organization at scale without centralized coordination overhead.
