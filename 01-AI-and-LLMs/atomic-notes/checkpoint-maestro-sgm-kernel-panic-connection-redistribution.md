# CheckPoint Maestro SGM Kernel Panic Connection Redistribution

## Core Concept
When a Security Group Member (SGM) experiences a kernel panic, CheckPoint Maestro automatically redistributes affected connections to backup SGMs without dropping connections, utilizing HyperSync technology for seamless failover.

## Connection Redistribution Behavior

### Immediate Failover Process
- **Active-Backup Architecture**: Each connection is synchronized between two SGMs (Active handler and Backup standby)
- **Instant Takeover**: When Active SGM fails due to kernel panic, Backup SGM immediately assumes processing
- **State Preservation**: Connection state already exists on Backup SGM via HyperSync synchronization
- **No Connection Drops**: Designed to maintain session continuity without packet loss

### Orchestrator Response
- **Failure Detection**: Orchestrator identifies unresponsive SGM via missed CCP heartbeats
- **Dynamic Rebalancing**: New connections automatically distribute across remaining operational SGMs
- **Load Redistribution**: Traffic load dynamically recalculated among healthy cluster members

### Technical Implementation
- **HyperSync Technology**: Patented connection-level synchronization ensures state redundancy
- **CCP Monitoring**: Cluster Control Protocol heartbeats enable rapid failure detection
- **Hardware-based Load Balancing**: 300-400ns latency ensures minimal performance impact

## Research Context
Essential for understanding Maestro's fault tolerance in high-availability environments where SGM hardware failures must not impact active connections or user sessions.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Sources**: CheckPoint Maestro Administration Guide, HyperSync technical documentation
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10 (Official technical documentation with verified behavior)
- **Validation Method**: Cross-referenced with R81.10 JHF Take 79 kernel panic resolution documentation (PRJ-54398, PRJ-57107)

## Connection Potential
Links to HyperSync architecture, cluster health monitoring, hardware failure recovery, and N+1 clustering patterns.

## Known Issues & Resolutions
- **R81.10 JHF Take 79**: Resolved kernel panics caused by VPN traffic (PRJ-54398) and memory leaks (PRJ-57107)
- **Memory Corruption**: FWK process failures trigger automatic redistribution
- **GTP-U Traffic**: Previously dropped if misclassified (PRJ-56442 resolved)

## Monitoring Commands
- `cpview` - Track SGM resource usage (CPU/memory) to preempt failures
- `cphaprob syncstat` - Check synchronization status
- `fw ctl pstat` - Validate packet processing statistics
- `cpinfo` collection for failure analysis
