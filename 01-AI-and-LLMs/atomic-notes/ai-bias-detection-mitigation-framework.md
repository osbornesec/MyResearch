# AI Bias Detection and Mitigation Framework

## Core Concept
Comprehensive bias detection and mitigation requires systematic approaches addressing training data bias, algorithmic bias, and process bias through pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing strategies achieving 23% bias reduction while maintaining performance.

## Research Context
With up to 70% of code now AI-generated, organizations face critical decisions about bias mitigation, transparency, and ethical responsibility requiring evidence-based governance frameworks.

## Three-Stage Mitigation Approach
1. **Pre-processing Mitigation**: Data resampling, reweighting, anonymization, and diverse dataset development
2. **In-processing Mitigation**: Fairness constraints, adversarial debiasing, and fairness-aware algorithms  
3. **Post-processing Mitigation**: Real-time monitoring, threshold optimization, and feedback loops

## Bias Detection Dimensions
- **Training Data Bias**: Provenance tracking, fairness audits, automated bias detection tools
- **Algorithmic Bias**: XAI techniques (SHAP, LIME), continuous testing, adversarial probing
- **Process Bias**: Development workflow discrimination and recommendation system bias

## Performance Impact
- 23% bias reduction while maintaining acceptable system performance
- Integration with XAI techniques for transparent decision-making
- Real-time monitoring enabling immediate bias correction
