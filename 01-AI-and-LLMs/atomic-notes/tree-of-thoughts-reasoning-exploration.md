# Tree of Thoughts Reasoning Exploration

## Core Concept
Tree of Thoughts (ToT) extends Chain of Thought by enabling models to explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously and evaluate them at intermediate steps. ToT allows for backtracking and exploration of alternative approaches when a particular path seems unpromising, using propose prompts to generate solutions and value prompts to evaluate paths.

## Research Context
ToT embodies iterative refinement as an explicit tree exploration of possible reasoning paths, showing particular strength in math reasoning, creative writing, and puzzles with higher success rates and more coherent results than linear approaches.
