# Memory Recomputation vs Checkpointing Trade-offs

## Core Concept
Trading extra computation to recompute intermediate values reduces memory footprint by 30-50% through selective checkpointing of activations, enabling larger models to run on constrained hardware by balancing memory usage against computational overhead.

## Performance Characteristics
- **Memory Reduction**: 30-50% footprint decrease through selective checkpointing
- **Computational Trade-off**: Extra computation exchanged for memory efficiency
- **Hardware Enablement**: Larger models on memory-limited systems
- **Selective Strategy**: Strategic choices about which values to preserve

## Technical Implementation
- **Recomputation Strategy**: Calculate intermediates on-demand instead of storing
- **Selective Activation Storage**: Strategic preservation of critical values
- **Checkpoint Placement**: Optimal points for memory-computation balance
- **Dynamic Optimization**: Runtime adjustment based on available resources

## Connection Points
- Links to [[precision-aware-inference-optimization]]
- Connects to [[heterogeneous-hardware-scheduling-ai-workloads]]
- Relates to [[dynamic-batching-ai-inference-optimization]]
- Bridges to [[speculative-decoding-autoregressive-optimization]]

## Enterprise Applications
- **Resource Optimization**: Deploy larger models within existing hardware constraints
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduce memory requirements without hardware upgrades
- **Scalability Enhancement**: Support more concurrent users with constrained resources
- **Performance Tuning**: Fine-tune memory-computation balance for specific workloads

## Optimization Strategies
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Memory-efficient backpropagation for training
- **Activation Recomputation**: On-demand calculation of intermediate values
- **Memory Pooling**: Efficient allocation and deallocation of temporary storage
- **Cache Management**: Intelligent retention of frequently accessed values

## Quality Metrics
- **Memory Utilization**: Reduction in peak memory usage measurements
