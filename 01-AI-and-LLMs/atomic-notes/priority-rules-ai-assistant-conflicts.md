# Priority Rules for AI Assistant Conflicts

## Core Concept
Resolving conflicts when multiple AI assistants offer overlapping suggestions requires deterministic priority orders (e.g., Copilot > CodeWhisperer > Tabnine), contextual routing to designated tools for specific tasks, and interactive conflict prompts presenting unified suggestion lists.

## Research Context
Essential for managing overlapping AI assistant functionality, preventing decision fatigue from simultaneous suggestions and ensuring consistent user experience in multi-tool environments.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Managing Complex AI Coding Tool Ecosystems
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10
- **Validation Method**: Multi-tool conflict resolution studies

## Connection Potential
- Links to contextual routing strategies
- Connects to interactive conflict resolution
- Relates to latent overload anti-patterns
- Bridges to cognitive load management

## Implementation Details
- **Priority Rules**: Deterministic order for inline code completions and chat features
- **Single Suggestion Display**: Only one suggestion appears at a time to reduce confusion
- **Contextual Routing**: Specific tasks assigned to designated tools (unit tests to Copilot, refactoring to JetBrains)
- **Interactive Conflict Prompts**: Unified interface listing all tool outputs for developer choice
- **Responsibility Minimization**: Clear tool boundaries reduce overlapping responsibilities
