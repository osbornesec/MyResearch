# AI Generated Code Failure Taxonomy

## Core Concept

AI-generated code exhibits systematic failure patterns across three primary categories: functional failures (counterfeit code, logic errors, incomplete generation), security failures (vulnerability injection, data exposure, authentication flaws), and integration failures (architectural inconsistency, dependency issues, context loss), with error rates ranging from 30.5% to 62.07% in production environments.

## Primary Failure Categories

### Functional Failure Modes
- **Counterfeit Code Generation**: Syntactically correct but functionally flawed code passing compilation checks
- **Logic and Algorithmic Errors**: Inefficient function calls, suboptimal algorithms, improper language feature usage
- **Incomplete Code Generation**: Missing error handling, unfinished loops, partial function implementations

### Security Failure Modes
- **Vulnerability Injection**: 248 CWE vulnerabilities across 19 types in sample analysis
- **Data Exposure**: 3x surge in PII exposure, 10x increase in missing authorization APIs
- **Authentication Flaws**: Weak authentication mechanisms, bypassed security controls

### Integration and System Failures
- **Architectural Inconsistency**: Misalignment with existing system architecture and patterns
- **Dependency Hallucination**: Non-existent libraries, methods, and APIs creating phantom dependencies
- **Context Loss**: Business requirement misalignment due to context window limitations

## Impact Metrics

- **Error Rate**: 30.5% to 62.07% of AI-generated code contains errors
- **Security Risk**: Up to 52% of generated code contains security vulnerabilities
- **Technical Debt**: 5.6 to 9.1 minutes per code snippet maintenance overhead
- **Performance Degradation**: 37.6% security degradation after five AI refinement iterations

## Research Context

Critical foundation for AI code quality assurance, enterprise risk management, and production deployment strategies requiring systematic failure prevention and recovery mechanisms.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Sources**: Empirical studies across multiple AI coding platforms and enterprise environments
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10
- **Validation Method**: Multi-source quantitative analysis with production data
