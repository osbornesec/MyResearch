# CheckPoint Maestro Rolling Update Procedures Multi-Version Cluster

## Core Concept
CheckPoint Maestro enables zero-downtime rolling updates through Multi-Version Cluster (MVC) technology, allowing different software versions to operate simultaneously during upgrade transitions. This capability maintains service continuity while upgrading from R81 to R82 across hyperscale security group deployments.

## MVC Architecture
- **Multi-Version Tolerance**: HyperSync maintains state synchronization across heterogeneous cluster members running different software versions
- **Traffic Redistribution**: New connections route to upgraded members while existing sessions persist on original nodes
- **Subgroup Partitioning**: Security groups split into logical subgroups (Group A/B) for sequential upgrade
- **Connection Persistence**: Existing sessions maintained until natural termination during version transitions

## Upgrade Workflow
1. **Management Server Validation**: Verify R82 compatibility against sk113113 matrix
2. **Orchestrator Upgrade First**: Apply R82 packages via `installer import`, `verify package`, `installer upgrade`
3. **Security Group Partitioning**: Use `maestro_util` script (sk177624) to create logical subgroups
4. **Sequential Subgroup Upgrade**: Apply R82 to Subgroup A, validate, then upgrade Subgroup B
5. **Post-Upgrade Validation**: VSX gateways require `vsx_util upgrade` for object version updates

## Critical Prerequisites
- **R81.20**: Requires Take 92+ of Jumbo Hotfix Accumulator before R82 upgrade
- **R81.10**: Requires Take 172+ before R82 migration
- **Legacy Versions**: R80.30SP/R80.20SP require multi-stage upgrades via intermediate R81.20
- **LACP Limitations**: Bond interfaces in LACP mode trigger PMTR-88191 defect, requiring minimum-downtime procedures

## Validation and Rollback
- **Pre-Upgrade Verifier**: CLI tool `migrate_server verify` checks disk space, synchronization health, pending changes
- **MVC Window**: Cluster members must homogenize versions within 72 hours to prevent state drift
- **Rollback Capability**: Downgrade subgroups by reinstating previous CPUSE packages within 4-hour retention window
- **Risk Assessment**: PUV generates reports critical for change approval and risk management

## Limitations and Constraints
- **LACP Bond Interfaces**: Cannot undergo MVC upgrades, forcing full-group shutdown procedures
- **VSX Configuration**: Requires explicit `vsx_util upgrade` to prevent management database schema conflicts
- **Hardware Dependencies**: Orchestrator 140-series required for R82 features like ElasticXL
- **Version Dependencies**: Management servers must run R82 to administer R82 security groups

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: CheckPoint R81.20SP Maestro Admin Guide, sk177624, R82 Scalable Platforms Guide
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Multi-source verification from official CheckPoint documentation and upgrade procedures
