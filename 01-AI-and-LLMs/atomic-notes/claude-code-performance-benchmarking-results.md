# Claude Code Performance Benchmarking Results

## Core Concept

Claude Code demonstrates significant performance improvements over traditional CLI tools: 3x faster UI updates (40ms vs 120ms), 13x smaller memory footprint (18MB vs 240MB), 2.7x faster tool invocation, and 8x faster context switching.

## Performance Metrics

**Benchmarked Comparisons**:
- **UI Update Speed**: 40ms vs 120ms traditional (3x improvement)
- **Memory Usage**: 18MB vs 240MB traditional (13x reduction)
- **Tool Invocation**: 300ms vs 800ms traditional (2.7x improvement)
- **Context Switch**: 50ms vs 400ms traditional (8x improvement)

**Token Usage Patterns**:
- Single-agent task: ~1,000 tokens
- Multi-agent coordination: ~15,000 tokens
- Complex research: ~50,000 tokens
- Enterprise migration: ~200,000 tokens
