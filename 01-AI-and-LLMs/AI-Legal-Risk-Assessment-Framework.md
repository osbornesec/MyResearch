## Framework Overview

This comprehensive legal risk assessment framework provides systematic evaluation methodologies for intellectual property, liability, and compliance considerations in AI-generated code development. Based on validated legal frameworks from [[intellectual-property-ai-generated-code-legal-frameworks]], [[product-liability-ai-coding-tools-allocation]], and [[professional-negligence-ai-assisted-development-standards]], this framework enables proactive identification and mitigation of legal risks throughout the AI development lifecycle.

    def assess_project_risk(self, project_params):
        total_risk_score = 0.0
        
        # IP Risk Assessment
        ip_risk = self.evaluate_ip_risk(
            project_params['ai_tools'],
            project_params['training_data'],
            project_params['human_involvement']
        )
        
        # Professional Liability Assessment
