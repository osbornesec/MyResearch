# Mobile Access Troubleshooting Methodology

## Core Concept
Mobile Access portal troubleshooting follows a systematic diagnostic approach examining configuration changes, logs, certificates, SSL handshake, and core processes.

## Initial Diagnostic Steps
- **Configuration Change Review**: Check recent changes that may have caused portal unresponsiveness
- **Log Analysis**: Review SmartView Tracker logs for related events
- **Core Dump Check**: Examine /var/log/dump/usermode/ for crash indicators
- **Certificate Validation**: Verify correct certificate configuration in Portal settings tab

## SSL Handshake Verification
- **Certificate Display**: Check certificate appearance in browser address bar
- **Wireshark Analysis**: Look for client_hello and server_hello SSL handshake messages
- **SSL Debug**: Collect kernel debug using "fw ctl zdebug -m fw + drop crypt cptls"

## Process and Service Diagnostics
- **SSLVPN Portal Status**: Check service with "mpclient status sslvpn"
- **HTTPD Port Discovery**: Get high port using "mpclient getdata sslvpn"
- **Process Verification**: Use "ps -ef |grep httpd |grep sslvpn" for running processes
- **Service Testing**: Test localhost connectivity with telnet to HTTPD high port

## Daemon and Log Analysis
- **VPND Debug**: Check VPND process debugging procedures
- **MPDAEMON Review**: Examine matching component responsible for HTTPD launching
- **HTTPD Start Logs**: Review $CVPNDIR/log/httpd.starlog for startup issues
- **Debug Logs**: Enable HTTPD debugging and monitor $CVPNDIR/log/httpd.log
