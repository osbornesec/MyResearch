# VSX Virtual System Orphaned Configuration Cleanup Command

## Core Concept
`vsx vspurge` is a Check Point VSX maintenance command that removes orphaned Virtual System entries and refetches current configuration from the Security Management Server to maintain configuration integrity.

## Operational Workflow
The command performs a two-phase cleanup operation:

1. **Purge Phase**: Removes invalid entries from `local.vskeep` configuration file
   - Orphaned Virtual System references without active policy assignments
   - Deleted VSX object configuration remnants
   - Invalid routing table entries from removed Virtual Routers

2. **Refetch Phase**: Synchronizes with SMS to rebuild clean configuration
   - Validates Virtual System definitions against current SMS topology
   - Updates cluster peer relationships
   - Refreshes VSX configuration data

## Technical Requirements
- **Expert Mode execution** required on Scalable Platform Security Groups
- **SIC-established connection** to Security Management Server
- **Maintenance window recommended** due to brief service interruption during execution

## Command Syntax
```bash
vsx vspurge
```

## Performance Impact
Reduces memory overhead by 15-20% in environments with frequent VSX topology changes by eliminating configuration drift and orphaned references.

## Connection Potential
- Links to [[checkpoint-vsx-stat]] for pre-execution cluster validation
- Connects to [[checkpoint-vsx-fetch]] for partial configuration synchronization alternatives
- Related to [[checkpoint-vsx-util]] for broader VSX management operations
- Associates with [[checkpoint-cphaprob-stat]] for post-execution cluster health verification

## Best Practice Integration
Regular quarterly execution prevents configuration corruption and maintains optimal VSX performance, particularly in dynamic environments with frequent Virtual System modifications.
