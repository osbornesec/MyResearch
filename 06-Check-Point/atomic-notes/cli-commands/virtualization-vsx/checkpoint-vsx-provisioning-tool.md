# CheckPoint VSX Provisioning Tool Command-Line Utility

## Core Concept
The VSX provisioning tool (`vsx_provisioning_tool`) is a command-line utility for managing Virtual Device lifecycle operations on VSX Gateways, enabling automated provisioning, configuration, and removal of Virtual Systems, Virtual Routers, and Virtual Switches directly from the Security Management Server.

## Key Operations Framework
The tool provides structured operations for complete Virtual Device management:
- **Gateway Management**: `add-vsx-gateway`, `add-vsx-cluster`, `remove-vsx`
- **Virtual Device Lifecycle**: `add-vd`, `remove-vd` for Virtual Systems/Routers/Switches
- **Interface Configuration**: `add-vd-interface`, `add-physical-interface`, `attach-bridge`
- **Network Configuration**: `add-route` for static routing assignment

## Automation Integration Capability
Designed for integration with infrastructure automation tools including Ansible and Terraform, enabling programmatic VSX environment management through standardized CLI operations.

## Operational Prerequisites
Requires pre-configured multi-domain environment with Domain Management Servers established through SmartConsole before Virtual Device provisioning operations can commence.

## Research Context
Essential component of VSX architecture automation, enabling scalable virtual system deployment and management in enterprise CheckPoint environments.
