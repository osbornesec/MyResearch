# CheckPoint vsx_util view_vs_conf Command

## Core Concept
The `vsx_util view_vs_conf` command compares configurations between the Management Server and VSX Gateway, identifying discrepancies and supporting configuration consistency validation.

## Command Purpose
**Primary Function:**
- Compare Management Server and VSX Gateway configurations
- Identify configuration discrepancies and drift
- Support configuration consistency troubleshooting
- Validate configuration synchronization effectiveness

## Command Execution
```bash
vsx_util view_vs_conf -m <VSX_Gateway>
```

**Comparison Scope:**
- Virtual system configuration elements
- Network interface assignments
- Policy rule configurations
- Service and feature settings

## Configuration Analysis
**Discrepancy Detection:**
- Management Server vs Gateway configuration differences
- Policy installation status verification
- Network configuration synchronization validation
- Service configuration consistency checking

**Output Format:**
- Side-by-side configuration comparison
- Highlighted differences and inconsistencies
- Configuration element status indicators
- Synchronization recommendation suggestions

## Troubleshooting Applications
**Common Diagnostic Scenarios:**
- Configuration synchronization failures
- Policy installation verification issues
- Network connectivity problems with configuration root causes
- Virtual system behavior inconsistencies

**Systematic Analysis:**
- Configuration drift identification
- Change impact assessment
- Synchronization effectiveness validation
- Policy enforcement verification

## Configuration Management Support
**Change Control:**
- Pre-change configuration baseline documentation
- Post-change configuration verification
- Configuration compliance validation
- Change impact assessment support

**Quality Assurance:**
- Configuration consistency monitoring
- Policy installation verification
- Service configuration validation
- System health assessment

## Operational Workflow
**Standard Usage:**
1. **Pre-Assessment:**
   - Identify configuration consistency concerns
   - Document expected configuration state
   - Plan configuration synchronization approach

2. **Comparison Execution:**
