# checkpoint-fw-getifs-interface-enumeration-command

## Core Concept
The `fw getifs` command provides comprehensive interface enumeration and status information on Check Point firewalls, displaying all network interfaces with their configuration details, IP addresses, and operational states.

## Technical Implementation
```bash
fw getifs
```

**Output Components:**
- Interface name and type (eth0, bond0, VLAN, etc.)
- IP address and subnet mask assignments
- Interface operational status (up/down)
- Hardware address (MAC) information
- Interface configuration flags and attributes

## Diagnostic Applications
- **Network Troubleshooting**: Verify interface IP configurations and status
- **Connectivity Analysis**: Confirm interface operational states during network issues
- **Configuration Validation**: Ensure interfaces match intended network design
- **Pre-Implementation Verification**: Baseline interface status before changes

## Operational Context
Essential for administrators performing network diagnostics, configuration verification, and troubleshooting connectivity issues. Particularly valuable during initial firewall setup, network changes, or when investigating traffic flow problems.

## Integration Points
- Combined with `netstat -rn` for complete routing perspective
- Used alongside `fw stat` for comprehensive firewall status assessment
- Coordinated with `cphaprob stat` for cluster interface verification
- Integrated with topology validation procedures

## Best Practice Applications
- Regular interface status monitoring in operational procedures
- Documentation of interface configurations for change management
- Baseline establishment for performance monitoring protocols
- Integration into automated health check scripts and monitoring systems
