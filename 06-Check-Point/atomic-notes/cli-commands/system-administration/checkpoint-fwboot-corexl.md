# CheckPoint fwboot corexl Internal Memory Hook Display Command

## Core Concept

The `fwboot corexl` command displays internal memory addresses of hook functions for CoreXL Firewall instances, serving as a low-level diagnostic tool primarily intended for CheckPoint support and advanced troubleshooting rather than routine firewall administration.

## Technical Function

- **Primary Purpose**: Shows internal memory address of hook function for specified CoreXL Firewall instances
- **Usage Context**: Internal diagnostics and advanced troubleshooting scenarios
- **Access Level**: CheckPoint support and expert-level troubleshooting
- **Output Type**: Memory address information for CoreXL hook functions

## Administrative Context

- **Not for Routine Use**: Should not be used for day-to-day CoreXL management
- **Preferred Management**: Use `cpconfig` menu for CoreXL configuration changes
- **Alternative Commands**: `fw ctl multik stat` for operational CoreXL monitoring
- **Configuration Method**: SmartConsole or `cpconfig` for standard CoreXL management

## Security Architecture Integration

Operates at the lowest level of CheckPoint's CoreXL performance enhancement system, providing visibility into the memory-level implementation of parallel firewall instance coordination.
