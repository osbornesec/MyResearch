# CheckPoint RTM Monitor Traffic Analysis

## Core Concept

The `rtm monitor` command in CheckPoint Security Gateways initiates real-time monitoring of network traffic on all interfaces and directions, providing immediate visibility into traffic patterns, performance metrics, and network activity for analysis and troubleshooting.

## Command Functionality

- **Real-Time Traffic Monitoring**: Live monitoring of network traffic across all interfaces
- **Traffic Pattern Analysis**: Immediate visibility into traffic flows and patterns
- **Performance Visibility**: Real-time performance metrics and statistics
- **Selective Monitoring**: Option to monitor specific virtual links or interfaces

## Technical Implementation

Command syntax:
```bash
rtm monitor                    # Monitor all traffic on all interfaces
rtm monitor [interface_id]     # Monitor specific interface or virtual link
```

The monitoring system:
1. Activates real-time data collection on specified interfaces
2. Displays live traffic statistics and performance metrics
3. Provides immediate feedback on network activity
4. Supports both comprehensive and targeted monitoring approaches

## Monitoring Capabilities

- **All Traffic Monitoring**: Comprehensive view across all interfaces when used without options
- **Interface-Specific Monitoring**: Targeted monitoring of specific virtual links or interfaces
- **Direction Analysis**: Traffic monitoring in all directions (ingress/egress)
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time statistics on throughput, connections, and resource utilization

## Status Integration

Works in conjunction with:
- `rtm stat` - Check RTM module status and configuration
- `rtm drv` - Manage underlying kernel driver
- SmartView Monitor - GUI-based monitoring interface

## Use Cases

- **Traffic Analysis**: Real-time examination of network traffic patterns
- **Performance Troubleshooting**: Immediate visibility into performance issues
- **Capacity Planning**: Live monitoring for resource utilization assessment
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time traffic analysis for security events
