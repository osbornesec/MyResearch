# CheckPoint RTM Real Time Monitoring System

## Core Concept
CheckPoint RTM (Real Time Monitoring) is a comprehensive monitoring framework that provides continuous visibility into network security infrastructure performance, threat detection, and system health metrics in real-time.

## Key Components
- **Performance Metrics Collection**: CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization
- **Security Event Monitoring**: IPS detection, threat prevention alerts, policy violations
- **Connection Tracking**: Active session monitoring and anomaly detection
- **System Health Monitoring**: Service status, daemon health, hardware diagnostics

## Technical Implementation
RTM operates through:
- Kernel-level data collection for minimal performance impact
- SNMP integration for external monitoring system compatibility
- Web-based dashboard for real-time visualization
- API endpoints for programmatic access to monitoring data

## Operational Benefits
- **Proactive Issue Detection**: Identify problems before they impact operations
- **Performance Optimization**: Data-driven insights for resource allocation
- **Security Posture Visibility**: Real-time threat landscape awareness
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated data collection for audit requirements

## Integration Context
RTM complements CheckPoint's SecureXL acceleration and CoreXL multi-core processing by providing performance visibility into optimized packet processing workflows and identifying bottlenecks in high-throughput environments.
