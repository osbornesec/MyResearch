# CheckPoint MQ Management Queue System

## Core Concept
The mq_mng (management queue) system in CheckPoint SecureXL manages multiple traffic queues per network interface, enabling parallel packet processing across multiple CPU cores for enhanced performance.

## Technical Details
- **Multi-Queue Architecture**: Allows supported network interfaces to use multiple receive (RX) and transmit (TX) queues instead of single queue per interface
- **CPU Core Distribution**: Enables multiple CPU cores to process packets in parallel from different queues
- **Default Behavior**: Enabled automatically on interfaces with supported drivers when SecureXL is active
- **Performance Impact**: Significantly improves throughput on high-traffic Security Gateways

## SecureXL Integration
- Part of CheckPoint's core acceleration technology framework
- Works within SecureXL's packet acceleration pipeline
- Maintains security policy enforcement while optimizing performance
- Automatically manages queue assignment and load distribution

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: CheckPoint official documentation
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10
- **Validation Method**: Multi-source technical verification
