# CheckPoint Process Monitor System Monitoring Framework

## Core Concept
CheckPoint process monitoring provides advanced system-level monitoring capabilities for tracking security process status, performance metrics, and runtime behavior, enabling administrators to monitor critical security services and detect performance issues or system anomalies in CheckPoint security gateway operations.

## Process Monitoring Architecture
The framework encompasses comprehensive process oversight:
- **Security Process Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of critical CheckPoint security processes and daemon status
- **Performance Metrics Collection**: Resource utilization tracking for individual processes including CPU, memory, and I/O usage
- **Health Status Monitoring**: Automated detection of process failures, hangs, and performance degradation
- **Event Logging**: Detailed logging of process events, state changes, and performance threshold violations

## Advanced Monitoring Capabilities
Extended monitoring features for enterprise environments:
- **Process Lifecycle Management**: Complete tracking of process startup, runtime, and shutdown operations
- **Resource Correlation**: Analysis of process resource consumption patterns and system impact assessment
- **Performance Baseline Establishment**: Historical performance data collection for anomaly detection and capacity planning
- **Automated Alert Generation**: Intelligent alerting based on process health criteria and performance thresholds

## Integration with System Monitoring
Process monitoring integrates with broader CheckPoint monitoring framework:
- **CPView Integration**: Process status display within comprehensive system monitoring interface
- **SNMP Integration**: Process monitoring data exposure through SNMP for external monitoring systems
- **Log Correlation**: Process events correlation with security logs and system events for comprehensive analysis
- **Management Interface**: Process monitoring data presentation through SmartConsole and CLI interfaces

## Research Context
Critical component of CheckPoint system health monitoring, providing detailed process-level visibility for maintaining optimal security gateway performance and reliability.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: CheckPoint System Monitoring and Performance documentation
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10
- **Validation Method**: Technical documentation review and monitoring framework verification
