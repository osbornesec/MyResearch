# Check Point FWM Main Command Interface

## Core Concept

The `fwm` command is Check Point's primary management operations interface that performs various administrative tasks and displays management information on Security Management Servers. It serves as the central command-line tool for security policy management, certificate operations, database management, and system administration tasks.

## Command Structure

```bash
fwm [-d]
    dbload <options>          # Database operations
    exportcert <options>      # Certificate export
    fetchfile <options>       # OPSEC file retrieval
    fingerprint <options>     # Fingerprint display
    getpcap <options>         # IPS packet capture
    ikecrypt <options>        # Secret encryption
    load <options>            # Policy loading (obsolete R80+)
    logexport <options>       # Log file export
    mds <options>             # Multi-Domain operations
    printcert <options>       # Certificate details
    sic_reset                 # SIC reset operations
    snmp_trap <options>       # SNMP trap sending
    unload <options>          # Policy unloading
    ver <options>             # Version information
    verify <options>          # Policy verification (obsolete R80+)
```

## Technical Requirements

- **Context Dependency**: On Multi-Domain Servers, commands must run within appropriate Domain Management Server context
- **Debug Mode**: `-d` parameter available for troubleshooting with output redirection recommended
- **Process Monitoring**: Monitored by Check Point Watchdog alongside `fwd`, `cpd`, and other core processes
- **Version Considerations**: Some subcommands (load, verify) obsoleted in R80+ in favor of `mgmt_cli`

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point Admin Foundation CLI Guide R81.20
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor documentation

## Connection Potential
- Links to [[checkpoint-mgmt-cli]] (modern R80+ replacement)
- Connects to [[checkpoint-multi-domain-management]] (MDS context)
- Related to [[checkpoint-security-policy-management]] (core function)
- Associated with [[checkpoint-watchdog-process-monitoring]] (system integration)
