# Checkpoint FW CTL Uninstall Command

## Core Concept
The `fw ctl uninstall` command removes the Check Point firewall kernel module from memory, effectively disabling the firewall functionality without stopping the firewall daemon process.

## Technical Details
- **Command**: `fw ctl uninstall`
- **Purpose**: Unload firewall kernel module from memory
- **Impact**: Firewall inspection stops but daemon remains running
- **Scope**: Affects kernel-level packet processing
- **Reversibility**: Requires `fw ctl install` to restore functionality

## Operational Context
This command is typically used for:
- Troubleshooting firewall kernel issues
- Temporary firewall bypass for debugging
- Maintenance operations requiring kernel module reload
- Emergency access scenarios

## Risk Considerations
- **Security Impact**: Disables all firewall protection
- **Traffic Flow**: All traffic passes uninspected
- **Monitoring**: Security events stop being generated
- **Clustering**: May affect cluster synchronization

## Related Commands
- `fw ctl install` - Reinstall firewall kernel module
- `fw stat` - Check firewall status
- `fw ctl debug` - Debug firewall operations

## Connection Potential
Links to kernel module management, firewall troubleshooting, and emergency access procedures.
