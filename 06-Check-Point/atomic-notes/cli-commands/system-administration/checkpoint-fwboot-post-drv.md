# CheckPoint fwboot post_drv Command - CoreXL Firewall Driver Boot Loading

## Core Concept

The `fwboot post_drv` command loads the Firewall driver for CoreXL during the boot process, providing the foundational driver layer required for CoreXL multi-core firewall operations on CheckPoint Security Gateways.

## Command Description

- **Purpose**: Loads IPv4 or IPv6 Firewall driver specifically for CoreXL architecture
- **Execution Context**: Expert mode only, boot-time driver loading
- **Critical Warning**: For CheckPoint internal use only - can block all traffic if misused
- **Recovery Requirement**: Console access needed if traffic blocking occurs

## Syntax

```bash
[Expert@HostName:0]# $FWDIR/boot/fwboot post_drv {ipv4 | ipv6}
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| No Parameters | Shows built-in help with available parameters |
| ipv4 | Loads the IPv4 Firewall driver for CoreXL |
| ipv6 | Loads the IPv6 Firewall driver for CoreXL |

## Usage Context

- **Boot Process Integration**: Essential component of CoreXL initialization sequence
- **Multi-Core Architecture**: Enables CoreXL's distributed firewall processing capabilities
- **Protocol-Specific Loading**: Separate driver loading for IPv4 and IPv6 stack support
- **Emergency Recovery**: Requires `cpstop`/`cpstart` or system reboot for traffic restoration

## Critical Safety Considerations

- **Internal Use Only**: Command designed for CheckPoint internal operations
- **Traffic Blocking Risk**: Improper usage can completely block network traffic
- **Console Access Required**: Physical or out-of-band access needed for recovery
- **Expert Mode Mandatory**: Cannot be executed from standard administrative shell
