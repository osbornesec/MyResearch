# Check Point RTM Debug Command Framework

## Core Concept
The `rtm debug` command provides real-time debugging capabilities for Check Point Real-Time Monitoring (RTM) processes, enabling deep inspection of system state, process behavior, and performance metrics during active troubleshooting sessions.

## Command Structure
```bash
rtm debug [options] [module] [parameters]
```

## Primary Debug Capabilities
- **Process State Inspection**: Real-time monitoring of RTM daemon status and resource utilization
- **Module-Specific Debugging**: Targeted debugging for specific RTM components (network, policy, logs)  
- **Performance Metrics Collection**: Live collection of timing, throughput, and resource consumption data
- **Error State Analysis**: Detailed examination of error conditions and failure modes

## Operational Context
RTM debug is essential for diagnosing complex Check Point performance issues where standard monitoring tools provide insufficient visibility into internal process behavior and system interactions.
