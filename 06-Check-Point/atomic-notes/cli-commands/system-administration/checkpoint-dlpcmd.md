- Integration with SIEM and security orchestration platforms
- Programmatic report generation for compliance

## Technical Context
Part of Check Point's comprehensive security management suite, `dlpcmd` operates alongside other Check Point command-line tools like `cpstat`, `fw ctl`, and `fwaccel` to provide complete firewall and security management capabilities.

## Connection Potential
- Links to Check Point policy management workflows
- Connects to security automation and orchestration patterns
- Related to compliance monitoring and reporting systems
- Integrates with incident response and forensic analysis procedures
