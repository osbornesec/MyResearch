# Check Point FWM Load Command - Firewall Module Loading

## Core Concept
The `fwm load` command in Check Point firewalls loads security policy rules and configuration into the firewall kernel module, making policy changes active on the security gateway.

## Technical Function
- **Purpose**: Transfers compiled security policy from management database to enforcement points
- **Execution Context**: Runs on Security Management Server or directly on gateway
- **Result**: Policy becomes active and begins processing network traffic according to new rules
- **Verification**: Policy installation status can be confirmed through SmartConsole or command line

## Command Syntax
```bash
fwm load [policy_name] [target_gateway]
fwm load -t [target] [policy_name]
```

## Operational Characteristics
- **Prerequisites**: Policy must be successfully compiled before loading
- **Network Impact**: Brief connection interruption possible during policy transition
- **Error Handling**: Failed loads preserve previous policy state for continuity
- **Logging**: Installation events recorded in management logs and gateway logs
