# CheckPoint FWBoot - Firewall Boot Process Control

## Core Concept
The `fwboot` command controls the CheckPoint firewall's boot process behavior and timing configurations, providing critical system startup management capabilities for security gateway initialization.

## Technical Function
- **Boot Process Control**: Manages firewall startup sequence and timing
- **System Initialization**: Controls security gateway boot parameters
- **Startup Configuration**: Defines boot-time security policy loading behavior
- **Recovery Management**: Provides boot-level recovery and diagnostic capabilities

## Primary Use Cases
- Configuring firewall boot timing and sequence parameters
- Managing security policy loading during system startup
- Troubleshooting boot-related security gateway issues
- Implementing boot-level security and recovery procedures

## Operational Context
Essential for CheckPoint security gateway administrators managing system startup behavior, particularly in high-availability environments where boot timing coordination is critical for cluster synchronization and failover scenarios.
