# CheckPoint Firewall Control Install Command

## Core Concept
The `fw ctl install` command tells the operating system to start passing packets to the CheckPoint Firewall, essentially "loading" the firewall functionality to begin packet inspection and processing.

## Command Syntax
```bash
fw [-d] ctl install
```

## Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `-d` | Runs the command in debug mode. Use only for troubleshooting the command itself. Best practice is to redirect output to a file when using debug mode. |

## Description
- Instructs the operating system to begin routing network packets through the CheckPoint Firewall engine
- Automatically executed when the Security Gateway starts or when an administrator runs the `cpstart` command
- Essential for activating firewall packet inspection capabilities

## Important Warnings
- Running `fw ctl uninstall` followed by `fw ctl install` does NOT restore the Security Policy
- To properly restore functionality after uninstall, you must run either:
  - `fw fetch` command, or
  - `cpstart` command

## Usage Context
- Part of the firewall startup process
- Used for firewall troubleshooting and maintenance
- Complementary command to `fw ctl uninstall` which stops packet processing

## Research Context
This command is fundamental to CheckPoint firewall operations, representing the "loading" mechanism that activates packet inspection. Note: No specific "fw ctl load" command exists in the documentation - `fw ctl install` serves this loading function.
