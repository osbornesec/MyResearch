# Check Point fw ctl multik start Command

## Core Concept
The `fw ctl multik start` command initiates CoreXL multi-kernel operation on Check Point security gateways, enabling parallel processing across multiple CPU cores for enhanced firewall performance.

## Technical Details
- **Purpose**: Starts the CoreXL multi-kernel framework
- **Context**: Used when CoreXL is disabled or after system maintenance
- **Prerequisites**: CoreXL must be properly configured in gateway settings
- **Impact**: Enables parallel packet processing across available CPU cores

## Command Syntax
```bash
fw ctl multik start
```

## Related Operations
- **Status Check**: `fw ctl multik stat` - verify multi-kernel operation status
- **Stop Operation**: `fw ctl multik stop` - halt multi-kernel processing
- **Configuration**: CoreXL settings managed through gateway configuration

## Performance Implications
- Enables significant throughput improvements on multi-core systems
- Distributes firewall inspection load across available CPU cores
- Critical for high-performance Check Point gateway deployments
