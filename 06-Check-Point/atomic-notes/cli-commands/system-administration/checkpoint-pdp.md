# CheckPoint Policy Decision Point (PDP)

## Core Concept

Policy Decision Point (PDP) is the central component in CheckPoint's security architecture that evaluates access requests against defined security policies and makes authorization decisions based on user identity, resource context, and environmental factors.

## Technical Implementation

The PDP operates as part of CheckPoint's Policy-Based Access Control framework, processing authentication tokens and contextual information to determine whether specific access requests should be granted or denied. It interfaces directly with Policy Enforcement Points (PEP) to implement decisions across the security infrastructure.

## Key Characteristics

- **Centralized Decision Making**: Single point of policy evaluation for consistent security enforcement
- **Context-Aware Processing**: Considers user attributes, resource sensitivity, and environmental conditions
- **Real-Time Evaluation**: Processes access requests with minimal latency impact
- **Policy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with CheckPoint's unified security policy framework
