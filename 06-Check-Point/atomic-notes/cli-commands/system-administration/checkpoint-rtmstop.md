# CheckPoint rtmstop Command Manual Daemon Termination

## Core Concept
The `rtmstop` command manually terminates the SmartView Monitor daemon on CheckPoint Security Gateways, stopping Real Time Monitoring (RTM) functionality for traffic analysis and system resource tracking.

## Technical Function
- **Primary Purpose**: Stops the RTM daemon process when graceful shutdown is required
- **Monitoring Scope**: Terminates traffic statistics, resource usage, interface status, and virtual link monitoring
- **Administrative Control**: Provides controlled daemon shutdown for maintenance and troubleshooting
- **Integration**: Works with SmartView Monitor for centralized management operations

## Operational Context
Manual RTM daemon termination is typically required when:
- Performing system maintenance that requires monitoring daemon shutdown
- RTM monitoring consumes excessive resources and needs forced termination
- Administrative reset of monitoring services requires clean daemon stop
- Troubleshooting requires monitoring service restart cycle

## Connection Potential
