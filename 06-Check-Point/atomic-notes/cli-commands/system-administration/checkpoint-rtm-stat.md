# CheckPoint RTM Stat Command Interface

## Core Concept
The `rtm stat` command provides real-time monitoring statistics for CheckPoint firewall resource utilization, including CPU usage, memory consumption, connection tracking, and throughput metrics essential for performance analysis and troubleshooting.

## Technical Implementation
```bash
rtm stat
# Displays current system resource statistics
# Including CPU, memory, connections, and throughput data
```

## Key Metrics Provided
- **CPU Utilization**: Per-core usage percentages and load distribution
- **Memory Statistics**: RAM usage, buffer allocation, and available memory
- **Connection Tracking**: Active connections, connection rate, and table utilization
- **Network Throughput**: Interface statistics, packet rates, and bandwidth utilization

## Performance Analysis Applications
Essential for identifying resource bottlenecks, monitoring system health during high-load periods, and establishing performance baselines for capacity planning and optimization decisions.
