# CheckPoint FW RepairLog - Log Pointer File Rebuilding Command

## Core Concept

The `fw repairlog` command rebuilds corrupted pointer files for CheckPoint Security and Audit log files, restoring the ability to read log databases when pointer files become corrupted.

## Command Description

CheckPoint Security log files (`$FWDIR/log/*.log`) and Audit log files (`$FWDIR/log/*.adtlog`) are databases with special pointer files. When these log pointer files become corrupted, they cause the inability to read the log file. The `fw repairlog` command can rebuild these pointer files to restore log accessibility.

## Syntax

```bash
fw repairlog [options] <log_file_name>
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `-d` | Runs the command in debug mode. Use only for troubleshooting the command itself. Best Practice: Redirect output to a file or use script command to save the entire CLI session. |
| `-u` | Specifies to rebuild the unification chains in the log file. |
| `<log_file_name>` | The name of the log file to repair. |

## Log File Types and Pointer Files

| Log File Type | Log File Location | Log Pointer Files |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Security log | `$FWDIR/log/*.log` | `*.logptr`<br>`*.logaccount_ptr`<br>`*.loginitial_ptr`<br>`*.logLuuidDB` |
| Audit log | `$FWDIR/log/*.adtlog` | `*.adtlogptr`<br>`*.adtlogaccount_ptr`<br>`*.adtloginitial_ptr`<br>`*.adtlogLuuidDB` |

## Usage Examples

### Repairing Audit Log File
```bash
fw repairlog -u 2013-06-17_000000.adtlog
```

### Repairing with Debug Mode
```bash
fw repairlog -d -u 2019-06-17_000000.adtlog > repair_debug.log
```

## When to Use

- Log files cannot be read or opened
- Log pointer files are corrupted
- Database integrity issues with CheckPoint log files
- After system crashes or unexpected shutdowns that may have corrupted log databases
