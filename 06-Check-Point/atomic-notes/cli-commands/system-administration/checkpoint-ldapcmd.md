# Check Point ldapcmd Command Line LDAP Management Utility

## Core Concept
`ldapcmd` is a command-line utility in Check Point Security Management that provides LDAP cache management, statistics monitoring, and debugging capabilities for maintaining LDAP authentication integration after initial configuration.

## Primary Functions
- **Cache Management**: Clear or view LDAP cache to ensure latest directory information
- **Statistics Monitoring**: Display LDAP query performance and usage metrics
- **Debug Operations**: Enable detailed logging for LDAP communication troubleshooting
- **Maintenance Tasks**: Post-configuration LDAP integration health monitoring

## Essential Commands
```bash
# Clear LDAP cache
ldapcmd cache -clear

# View LDAP statistics
ldapcmd stats

# Enable debug mode (levels 0-5)
ldapcmd <command> -d <debug_level>
```

## Operational Context
Used for maintaining and troubleshooting existing LDAP integrations configured through SmartConsole GUI. Not used for initial LDAP authentication setup, but essential for ongoing operational health.

## Connection Potential
- Links to Check Point Identity Awareness architecture
- Connects with LDAP authentication troubleshooting methodologies
- Related to Check Point user identity management workflows
- Integrates with Check Point logging and monitoring systems
