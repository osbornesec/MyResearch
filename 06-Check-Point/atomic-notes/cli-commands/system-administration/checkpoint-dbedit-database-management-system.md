# CheckPoint dbedit - Database Management System

## Command Purpose
Edits the CheckPoint management database ($FWDIR/conf/objects_5_0.C) on Security Management Server or Domain Management Server for direct object manipulation.

## Syntax Pattern
```
dbedit [-globallock] [-local | -s <Management_Server>] [-u <Username>] [-p <Password>] [options]
```

## Key Parameters
- **-globallock**: Prevents concurrent SmartConsole access during editing
- **-local**: Connect to localhost without authentication
- **-s <Management_Server>**: Specify remote management server
- **-f <File_Name>**: Execute commands from script file
- **-readonly**: Open database in read-only mode

## Critical Warning
DO NOT run unless explicitly instructed by CheckPoint Support or R&D. Improper use can corrupt the management database and render the system inoperable.

## System Context
Low-level database editing tool for emergency repairs, bulk modifications, and troubleshooting when SmartConsole cannot accomplish required changes. Requires expert knowledge of CheckPoint object model.
