# Check Point fgate Acceleration Framework

## Core Concept
fgate is Check Point's acceleration framework that implements fast-path packet processing by bypassing certain security inspections for established connections, significantly improving throughput performance.

## Technical Implementation
- **Fast-path Processing**: Established connections skip deep inspection layers
- **Connection State Tracking**: Maintains session information for acceleration decisions
- **Selective Bypass**: Only trusted, established flows receive acceleration treatment
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces CPU utilization for routine traffic processing

## Security Considerations
- **Initial Inspection**: First packets undergo full security analysis
- **Trust Establishment**: Connection must pass security validation before acceleration
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Maintains ability to revert to full inspection if needed
- **Policy Compliance**: Acceleration decisions respect security policy requirements

## Performance Impact
Enables significant throughput improvements by reducing per-packet processing overhead while maintaining security policy enforcement for connection establishment and anomaly detection.
