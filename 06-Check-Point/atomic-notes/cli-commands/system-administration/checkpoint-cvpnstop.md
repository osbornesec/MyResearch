# Check Point cvpnstop Command Interface

## Core Concept
The `cvpnstop` command is Check Point's primary utility for terminating VPN connections on endpoint devices, providing graceful disconnection with proper cleanup of tunnel resources and security policies.

## Technical Implementation
```bash
# Basic VPN connection termination
cvpnstop

# Force termination of all active connections
cvpnstop -f

# Stop specific connection by site name
cvpnstop -s [site-name]

# Graceful shutdown with cleanup verification
cvpnstop -c

# Debug mode termination for troubleshooting
cvpnstop -d
```

## Core Functionality
- **Connection Termination**: Gracefully closes secure tunnel to Check Point security gateway
- **Resource Cleanup**: Removes temporary files, certificates, and authentication tokens
- **Policy Removal**: Cleans up applied endpoint security policies post-disconnection
- **Route Restoration**: Restores original routing configuration after tunnel teardown
- **Session Management**: Properly terminates authenticated sessions and security associations

## Disconnection Process Flow
1. **Connection Identification**: Locates active VPN sessions and associated resources
2. **Graceful Shutdown Initiation**: Sends proper termination signals to gateway
3. **Tunnel Teardown**: Safely dismantles IPSec tunnel and clears encryption keys
4. **Policy Cleanup**: Removes endpoint security policies applied during connection
5. **Route Restoration**: Restores pre-VPN routing table configuration
6. **Resource Deallocation**: Cleans up temporary files and memory allocations

## Common Parameters
- `-f`: Force immediate termination without graceful shutdown
- `-s [site]`: Terminate connection to specific site or gateway
- `-c`: Perform cleanup verification after disconnection
- `-d`: Enable debug mode for disconnection troubleshooting
- `-a`: Terminate all active VPN connections simultaneously

## Integration Points
Coordinates with Check Point ecosystem components:
- **Endpoint Security Client**: Removes security policies and enforcement rules
- **Identity Awareness**: Properly logs out user identity sessions
- **Mobile Access**: Handles mobile device disconnection procedures
- **Compliance Blade**: Ensures compliance state restoration after disconnection

## Troubleshooting Context
Essential for resolving VPN disconnection issues, clearing stuck connections, and ensuring proper resource cleanup in Check Point environments.
