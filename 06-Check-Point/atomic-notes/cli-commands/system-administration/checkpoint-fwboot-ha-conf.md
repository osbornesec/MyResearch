# CheckPoint fwboot ha_conf Command for Cluster Boot Configuration

## Core Concept
The fwboot ha_conf command configures the cluster mechanism during system boot for Check Point ClusterXL environments. This internal-use command initializes high availability clustering parameters as part of the boot sequence.

## Command Syntax
```bash
$FWDIR/boot/fwboot ha_conf
```

## Usage Context
- **Execution mode**: Expert mode only
- **Access level**: Check Point internal use only
- **Boot integration**: Runs automatically during cluster member boot process
- **Configuration scope**: Affects cluster mechanism initialization

## Technical Details
- **Location**: $FWDIR/boot/fwboot
- **Purpose**: High availability configuration during boot
- **Automation**: Part of automated cluster initialization sequence
- **Prerequisites**: Must be executed from Expert mode prompt

## Operational Notes
- Command is for Check Point internal use and not intended for manual execution
- Automatically invoked during cluster member boot process
- Configures essential clustering parameters before firewall services start
- Critical for proper ClusterXL member initialization and communication

## Related Configuration
- Cluster installation requires R81.20 Installation and Upgrade Guide procedures
- Cluster configuration documented in R81.20 ClusterXL Administration Guide
- Works in conjunction with other fwboot commands for complete system initialization
