# Check Point FWM Exportcert SIC Certificate Export Command

## Core Concept
The `fwm exportcert` command exports SIC (Secure Internal Communication) certificates of specified managed objects to files, enabling certificate backup, distribution, and external integration with third-party systems.

## Command Syntax
```bash
fwm [-d] exportcert -obj <Name of Object> -cert <Name of CA> -file <Output File> [-withroot] [-pem]
```

## Parameters
- **-d**: Debug mode for troubleshooting (redirect output to file recommended)
- **-obj**: Name of the managed object whose certificate to export
- **-cert**: Name of Certificate Authority whose certificate to export
- **-file**: Output file name for the exported certificate
- **-withroot**: Include certificate's root in addition to certificate content
- **-pem**: Save as text file (default is binary format)

## Primary Use Cases
- **Certificate Backup**: Export certificates for disaster recovery purposes
- **Third-Party Integration**: Provide certificates to external systems requiring SIC authentication
- **Certificate Distribution**: Share certificates across multiple management environments
- **Compliance Documentation**: Export certificates for audit and regulatory requirements

## Multi-Domain Server Context
On Multi-Domain Servers, command must be executed within the appropriate Domain Management Server context:
```bash
mdsenv <IP Address or Name of Domain Management Server>
```

## Output Formats
- **Default**: Binary certificate file format
- **PEM Format**: Text-based certificate format using `-pem` parameter
- **With Root**: Complete certificate chain including root CA using `-withroot`

## Operational Context
Critical for SIC certificate lifecycle management, enabling secure communication establishment between Check Point components and integration with external PKI infrastructure.
