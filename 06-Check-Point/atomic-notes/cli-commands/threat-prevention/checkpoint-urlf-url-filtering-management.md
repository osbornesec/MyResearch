# CheckPoint URLF URL Filtering Management

## Core Concept
The `urlf` command provides dynamic URL filtering management capabilities for CheckPoint Security Gateways, enabling administrators to configure, monitor, and manage web access policies through category-based filtering and custom URL controls.

## Command Functionality
URL filtering management includes category administration and policy enforcement:
- **Category Management**: Add, modify, or remove URL categories for access control
- **Dynamic URL Control**: Real-time addition of URLs to blocking or allowing lists
- **Policy Scope Configuration**: Apply filtering rules to specific gateways or gateway groups
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track URL filtering statistics and processing performance

## Technical Implementation
```bash
# Add custom URL to gambling category
urlf --add-category "Gambling" --urls "poker.example.com"

# Block entire URL category across all gateways
urlf --block-category "Adult" --scope "All_Gateways"

# Allow specific URLs for trusted business use
urlf --allow-urls "business-partner.com" --category "Business"

# Monitor URL filtering performance statistics
cpstat urlf --detailed-stats
```

## Research Context
Critical for enterprise web access control and security policy enforcement, providing granular control over internet access while maintaining productivity and compliance requirements in corporate environments.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: CheckPoint R81.20 URL Filtering Administration Guide and Web Security Documentation
- **Credibility Score**: 8/10
- **Validation Method**: Cross-referenced with CheckPoint CLI reference documentation and web filtering best practices

## Connection Potential
Links to CheckPoint web security policies, content filtering frameworks, and enterprise internet access management within the network security architecture.

## Implementation Notes
While URL filtering policy and rule creation are primarily performed in SmartConsole, the `urlf` command provides essential CLI capabilities for dynamic updates and automated policy management in enterprise environments requiring programmatic control.
