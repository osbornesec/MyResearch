# CheckPoint IPS Debug Command

## Core Concept
The `ips debug` command is a CheckPoint CLI diagnostic tool that collects detailed debug information from the Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Software Blade, enabling in-depth troubleshooting of IPS-related issues including false positives, missed attacks, and performance problems.

## Technical Implementation
The command operates by capturing IPS engine activities with configurable packet filtering using INSPECT syntax similar to `fw monitor`. It provides granular control over debug scope through filter specifications and can output structured debug data to specified files for analysis.

## Command Syntax
```bash
ips debug [options]
  -e <Filter>      # INSPECT filter for packet capture
  -f <Output File> # Debug output file path and name
```

## Operational Context
Used during planned troubleshooting windows due to resource-intensive nature. Essential for investigating IPS rule mismatches, signature detection failures, and performance degradation issues. Debug sessions should be actively managed and terminated promptly to prevent performance impact.

## Performance Considerations
Debug operations can significantly impact system performance during execution. Recommended for use during maintenance windows or low-traffic periods with careful monitoring of system resources and immediate termination upon completion of diagnostic data collection.
