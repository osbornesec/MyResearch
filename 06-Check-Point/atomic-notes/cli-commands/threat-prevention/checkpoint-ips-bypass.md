# CheckPoint IPS Bypass - Core Protection Mechanism

## Core Concept
IPS Bypass is a critical security gateway mechanism that allows selective disabling of Intrusion Prevention System inspection to maintain system performance and availability during high resource utilization or specific operational conditions.

## Fundamental Purpose
Provides automatic failsafe mechanism to prevent system overload by temporarily disabling resource-intensive threat prevention features when CPU or memory utilization exceeds configurable thresholds, ensuring continuous network connectivity even under stress conditions.

## Key Operational States
- **Bypass Disabled**: IPS operates normally, inspecting all traffic
- **Bypass Enabled**: IPS inspection temporarily suspended based on resource thresholds
- **Adaptive Mode**: Automatic switching between enabled/disabled based on system load

## Critical Implementation Context
Essential for enterprise deployments where network availability takes precedence over inspection during resource constraints. Requires careful threshold configuration to balance security posture with system stability. Must be synchronized across cluster members in high-availability deployments.

## Connection Targets
- System performance optimization strategies
- High-availability and resilience architectures
- Enterprise security policy frameworks
- Network continuity assurance mechanisms
