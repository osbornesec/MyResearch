# CheckPoint IPS RefreshCap Packet Capture Refresh

## Core Concept

The `ips refreshcap` command in CheckPoint Security Gateways refreshes the IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) packet capture repository by marking the next packet of each IPS protection as the new "first packet" for capture purposes, effectively restarting the sample capture process.

## Command Functionality

- **Capture Repository Refresh**: Resets the packet capture sampling for all IPS protections
- **First Packet Redefinition**: Marks the next packet encountered by each protection as the new baseline
- **Sample Process Restart**: Ensures that captures reflect the latest network traffic patterns
- **Forensics Support**: Provides fresh packet samples for analysis and troubleshooting

## Technical Implementation

When executed, the command:
1. Iterates through all active IPS protections
2. Marks the next packet encountered by each protection as the new "first packet"
3. Resets the capture buffer for each protection
4. Enables fresh packet sampling for analysis purposes

## Use Cases

- **Debugging**: Obtain current traffic samples for troubleshooting IPS issues
- **Forensic Analysis**: Refresh captures to analyze recent attack patterns
- **Performance Analysis**: Ensure captured packets represent current network conditions
- **Baseline Establishment**: Reset capture baseline after configuration changes
