# CheckPoint Identity Collector Agentless Identity Acquisition

## Core Concept
The CheckPoint Identity Collector provides agentless identity acquisition capabilities by collecting identity information from Microsoft Active Directory security event logs and sharing this data with CheckPoint security gateways, enabling identity-based policy enforcement without requiring client agent deployment on user endpoints.

## Agentless Architecture Framework
Identity collector operates through centralized identity acquisition:
- **Active Directory Integration**: Direct collection of authentication events and user identity information from Active Directory security event logs
- **Centralized Identity Distribution**: Automatic distribution of collected identity information to CheckPoint security gateways for policy enforcement
- **Event Log Processing**: Real-time processing of Windows security events to extract user authentication and session information
- **Scalable Deployment Model**: Centralized collector deployment supporting multiple domains and organizational units

## Identity Information Collection
Comprehensive identity data acquisition capabilities:
- **User Authentication Events**: Collection of user login, logout, and authentication status changes from Active Directory
- **Session Management**: Tracking of user session establishment, maintenance, and termination across network infrastructure
- **Group Membership Resolution**: Active Directory group membership information collection for policy-based access control
- **Computer Association**: User-to-computer mapping for comprehensive identity context in policy enforcement

## Enterprise Integration Benefits
Identity collector provides significant deployment advantages:
- **Agent-Free Operation**: Eliminates requirement for client-side agent deployment and management in large enterprise environments
- **Reduced Administrative Overhead**: Centralized identity management without distributed client software maintenance
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Automatic identity acquisition for all Active Directory-authenticated users without individual client configuration
- **Legacy System Support**: Identity awareness capabilities for environments where agent deployment is not feasible or permitted

## Research Context
Essential component of CheckPoint Identity Awareness deployment options, providing scalable agentless identity acquisition for enterprise environments requiring comprehensive identity-based security policy enforcement.
