# CheckPoint PDP Nested Groups Hierarchy Resolution

## Core Concept
The `pdp nested_groups` command manages or queries nested Active Directory groups to resolve complex user-group relationships in hierarchical AD structures for Identity Awareness policy enforcement.

## Command Functionality
- **Primary Purpose**: Resolve complex Active Directory group hierarchies and nested group memberships
- **Group Resolution**: Flatten nested group structures to determine effective user permissions
- **Hierarchy Management**: Handle multi-level group nesting and inheritance patterns
- **Policy Context**: Provide accurate group membership information for identity-based policies

## Technical Context
- **Component**: Policy Decision Point (PDP) nested group resolution engine
- **AD Hierarchy Support**: Navigate complex Active Directory organizational structures
- **Group Expansion**: Recursive resolution of nested group memberships
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient handling of deep group nesting scenarios

## Nested Group Scenarios
- **Organizational Hierarchies**: Department-based group structures with multiple nesting levels
- **Role-Based Access**: Security groups nested within functional groups
- **Geographic Distribution**: Location-based groups with regional nesting
- **Project-Based Groups**: Temporary groups nested within permanent organizational structures

## Common Use Cases
- Configure nested group resolution for complex AD environments
- Troubleshoot policy enforcement issues related to group membership
- Optimize group resolution performance in deep hierarchy scenarios
- Validate user permissions derived from nested group memberships

## Resolution Capabilities
- **Recursive Expansion**: Complete flattening of nested group structures
- **Circular Reference Detection**: Identify and handle circular group dependencies
- **Performance Caching**: Optimize repeated group resolution requests
- **Incremental Updates**: Efficient handling of group membership changes

## Operational Considerations
- **Performance Impact**: Resource utilization for deep group hierarchy resolution
- **Caching Strategy**: Balance accuracy with performance for group membership queries
- **Update Frequency**: Synchronization with Active Directory group changes
- **Error Handling**: Manage scenarios with broken or circular group references

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: CheckPoint CLI documentation and Active Directory integration guides
- **Credibility Score**: 7/10
- **Validation Method**: Vendor documentation and complex AD deployment guides
