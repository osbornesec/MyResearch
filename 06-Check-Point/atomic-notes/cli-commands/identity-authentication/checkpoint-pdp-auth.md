# CheckPoint PDP Auth

## Core Concept
Policy Decision Point (PDP) authentication in Check Point architecture represents the centralized decision-making component that evaluates access requests against security policies before granting or denying authentication and authorization.

## Technical Function
The PDP auth system operates as the brain of Check Point's access control framework, receiving authentication requests, evaluating them against configured policies, and returning permit/deny decisions with appropriate attributes for enforcement points.

## Architecture Integration
PDP auth integrates with Policy Enforcement Points (PEP) and Policy Information Points (PIP) to create a complete policy-based access control system within Check Point's security infrastructure.

## Implementation Context
Critical for zero-trust architectures and identity-aware security policies where granular access control decisions must be made based on user identity, device state, network context, and behavioral patterns.

## Connection Potential
Links to CheckPoint identity awareness systems, zero-trust development frameworks, and multi-domain management coordination patterns within the vault's security architecture concepts.
