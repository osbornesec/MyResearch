# CheckPoint PDP Debug and Troubleshooting Diagnostics

## Core Concept
The `pdp debug` command enables or configures debugging for Policy Decision Point processes, providing detailed troubleshooting information for authentication and identity issues.

## Command Functionality
- **Primary Purpose**: Enable detailed logging and diagnostic information for PDP processes
- **Debug Scope**: Authentication decisions, identity resolution, and policy evaluation processes
- **Troubleshooting Enhancement**: Granular visibility into identity-based authentication failures
- **Performance Analysis**: Detailed timing and resource utilization information

## Technical Context
- **Component**: Policy Decision Point (PDP) debug subsystem
- **Logging Framework**: Enhanced verbosity for authentication and policy decision processes
- **Diagnostic Categories**: Authentication, authorization, identity resolution, and policy evaluation
- **Performance Impact**: Increased logging overhead during debug sessions

## Debug Information Categories
- **Authentication Events**: User login attempts, credential validation, and authentication failures
- **Policy Decisions**: Rule evaluation, access control decisions, and policy enforcement actions
- **Identity Resolution**: User-to-IP mapping, group membership resolution, and identity source queries
- **Communication**: Inter-service communication and external identity provider interactions

## Common Use Cases
- Diagnose authentication failures in Identity Awareness deployments
- Troubleshoot policy enforcement issues and access control decisions
- Analyze identity resolution problems and mapping failures
- Debug integration issues with external identity providers

## Debug Configuration Options
- **Log Level Control**: Adjustable verbosity for different diagnostic categories
- **Component Filtering**: Selective debugging for specific PDP subsystems
- **Output Formatting**: Structured logging for automated analysis and parsing
- **Performance Metrics**: Timing information for authentication and policy decisions

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: CheckPoint CLI documentation and troubleshooting guides
- **Credibility Score**: 7/10
- **Validation Method**: Vendor documentation and diagnostic procedure guides
