# CheckPoint sync_cluster State Coordination

## Core Concept

The `sync_cluster` command initiates and manages state synchronization operations between CheckPoint ClusterXL members, ensuring all cluster participants maintain consistent connection tables, routing information, and security policy state.

## Primary Functions

- **Manual Synchronization Trigger**: Initiates cluster-wide state synchronization
- **State Consistency Enforcement**: Ensures all members have identical kernel tables
- **Recovery Coordination**: Facilitates cluster recovery after communication failures
- **Administrative Control**: Provides manual override for automatic synchronization

## Synchronization Types

- **Full Synchronization**: Complete kernel table transfer from active to other members
- **Delta Synchronization**: Incremental updates for ongoing state changes
- **Recovery Synchronization**: Restoration of consistency after member rejoining
- **Policy Synchronization**: Security policy and configuration state alignment

## Usage Context

```bash
sync_cluster                # Initiate cluster-wide synchronization
sync_cluster [member-id]    # Synchronize specific cluster member
# Requires cluster administrative privileges
# May cause temporary performance impact during sync
```

## Synchronization Protocol

- **CCP Communication**: Uses Cluster Control Protocol over UDP port 8116
- **Kernel Integration**: Direct kernel-level state table synchronization
- **fwd Daemon Coordination**: Management daemon facilitates full sync operations
- **Priority Handling**: Critical state information synchronized first

## Operational Scenarios

- **Post-Failover Recovery**: Ensuring new active member has complete state
- **Member Rejoining**: Synchronizing member returning after failure
- **Maintenance Recovery**: Restoring consistency after planned maintenance
- **Troubleshooting**: Manual synchronization to resolve state inconsistencies

## Performance Considerations

- Large state tables may require significant synchronization time
- Network bandwidth consumption during full synchronization operations
- Temporary cluster performance impact during intensive sync operations
- Resource utilization on both source and target cluster members

## Integration Framework

- Coordinates with ClusterXL state management architecture
- Integrates with failover and recovery procedures
- Supports cluster member health monitoring
- Affects cluster correction statistics and metrics
