# CheckPoint cphaprob register Device Monitoring

## Core Concept

The `cphaprob register` command registers new critical devices or processes (Pnotes) for monitoring within CheckPoint ClusterXL, enabling them to influence failover decisions and cluster member health assessment.

## Primary Functions

- **Critical Device Registration**: Adds devices to cluster monitoring framework
- **Process Monitoring Setup**: Configures process-based health checks
- **Failover Trigger Configuration**: Establishes conditions that trigger member failure
- **Administrative Control**: Provides granular control over cluster health monitoring

## Registration Scope

- **Hardware Devices**: Network interfaces, storage systems, power supplies
- **Software Processes**: Critical daemons, security blades, management processes
- **Network Connectivity**: Gateway reachability, routing protocol status
- **Custom Monitors**: Application-specific health indicators

## Usage Context

```bash
cphaprob register [device-specification]
# Registers specified device for cluster monitoring
# Requires administrative privileges
# May require cluster member restart for activation
```

## Configuration Parameters

- **Device Type**: Hardware, process, or network connectivity monitor
- **Failure Threshold**: Conditions that constitute device failure
- **Recovery Criteria**: Requirements for device restoration
- **Priority Level**: Impact weight on overall cluster member health

## Operational Impact

- Newly registered devices immediately affect member health calculations
- Failure of registered critical devices triggers failover procedures
- Registration changes may require cluster configuration synchronization
- Impacts overall cluster fault tolerance and availability

## Integration Framework

- Coordinates with ClusterXL health monitoring architecture
- Integrates with failover decision algorithms
- Supports cluster correction and synchronization protocols
- Affects cluster member status reporting

## Source Attribution

- **Primary Source**: CheckPoint ClusterXL configuration documentation
- **Credibility Score**: 7/10 (limited specific command documentation)
- **Validation Method**: Inferred from cluster monitoring architecture
