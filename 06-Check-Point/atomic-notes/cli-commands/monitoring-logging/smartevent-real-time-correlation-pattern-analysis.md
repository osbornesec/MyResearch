# SmartEvent Real Time Correlation Pattern Analysis

## Core Concept
Check Point SmartEvent performs real-time event correlation based on pattern anomalies and historical data, automatically learning normal activity patterns and suggesting policy changes to reduce false alarms while identifying threats that may not be detectable when viewed in isolation.

## Correlation Mechanisms
- **Pattern Anomaly Detection**: Identifies deviations from established baseline behavior patterns
- **Historical Data Correlation**: Compares current events against previous data to detect trending threats
- **Multi-Device Correlation**: Aggregates data between multiple devices to reveal distributed attack patterns
- **Self-Learning Mode**: Automatically learns normal site activity patterns and suggests policy optimizations

## Threat Detection Capabilities
- **Isolated Event Aggregation**: Combines seemingly unrelated events to reveal coordinated attacks
- **Time-Based Analysis**: Correlates events across time periods to identify persistent threats
- **Cross-Device Pattern Recognition**: Detects attack patterns spanning multiple security devices
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Adapts detection sensitivity based on changing network conditions

## Operational Benefits
- **False Positive Reduction**: Self-learning capabilities minimize irrelevant alerts through pattern recognition
- **Threat Prioritization**: Automatically prioritizes events based on risk assessment and pattern severity
- **Real-Time Response**: Enables immediate threat mitigation through integrated Security Management Server actions
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Detects sophisticated attacks that traditional log analysis might miss
