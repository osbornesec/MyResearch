# CheckPoint Suspicious Activity Monitoring (SAM)

## Core Concept

Suspicious Activity Monitoring (SAM) is a real-time behavioral security analysis system that automatically blocks activities identified as suspicious based on connection patterns, frequency analysis, and security policy violations without requiring policy installation.

## Technical Implementation

SAM operates through dynamic Firewall rule injection, applying blocking rules immediately to Security Gateways when suspicious patterns are detected. Rules are applied in real-time without policy compilation or installation delays, enabling immediate threat response.

## Detection Capabilities

**Behavioral Analysis** - Monitors connection attempts, frequency patterns, and access behaviors to identify potential unauthorized access attempts or reconnaissance activities.

**Resource Protection** - Detects and blocks repeated attempts to access restricted network or internet resources, protecting against both external attacks and internal policy violations.

**Performance-Aware Operation** - SAM rules are designed with CPU resource considerations and configurable expiration times to maintain security effectiveness without impacting gateway performance.

## Operational Workflow

1. SmartView Monitor identifies suspicious connection patterns in real-time traffic analysis
2. Security administrators can create SAM rules directly from monitoring results
3. Rules are immediately deployed to relevant Security Gateways
4. Blocked activities are logged for analysis and policy refinement
5. Rules automatically expire based on configured timeframes

## Strategic Value

Bridges the gap between security policy and emerging threats by providing immediate response capabilities for activities that may not be explicitly covered by existing security rules.

## Connection Potential

Links to behavioral analytics platforms, threat intelligence systems, security orchestration tools, and automated incident response workflows for enhanced security operations.
