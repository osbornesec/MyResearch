# SmartLog Performance Tuning Resource Management

## Core Concept
Check Point SmartLog provides configurable performance tuning parameters including minimum disk space thresholds, RAM requirements, CPU core specifications, and time frame restrictions for log display, enabling administrators to optimize resource utilization based on system capacity and requirements.

## Resource Configuration Parameters
- **min_disk_space**: Minimum available disk space in MB before SmartLog stops indexing operations
- **min_required_ram_mb**: Minimum RAM requirement (configurable range 1-1024 MB)
- **min_required_cores**: Minimum CPU core requirement for SmartLog operations
- **num_days_restriction_for_fetch_all**: Time frame for log display (default 3 days)

## Performance Optimization Features
- **Adaptive Resource Management**: Automatically adjusts indexing operations based on available system resources
- **Storage Protection**: Prevents disk space exhaustion through configurable minimum space thresholds
- **Memory Allocation**: Ensures adequate RAM allocation for optimal query processing performance
- **Time-Based Filtering**: Limits default log retrieval timeframe to improve response times

## Configuration Example
```
:num_days_restriction_for_fetch_all (3)
:min_required_cores (1)
:min_required_disk_space_gb (1)
:min_required_ram_mb (9)
:server_port ("127.0.0.1:18242")
```

## Operational Benefits
- **System Protection**: Prevents resource exhaustion that could impact overall system performance
- **Scalable Performance**: Adapts to available hardware resources for optimal query response times
- **Administrative Control**: Enables fine-tuning based on specific environment requirements
- **Capacity Planning**: Provides clear metrics for hardware sizing and upgrade planning
