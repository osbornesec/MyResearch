# SmartLog Architecture Index Server GUI Separation

## Core Concept
Check Point SmartLog utilizes a client-server architecture separating the Index Server component from the GUI component. The Index Server handles log indexing and query processing, while the GUI provides the user interface for log analysis and investigation.

## Technical Implementation
- **Index Server**: Receives log files from multiple log servers, creates indexes for rapid data extraction, stores indexes in server directory pointing to original log files
- **GUI Client**: Connects to Index Server to submit queries and display results, automatically installed with SmartConsole suite
- **Communication**: Server and GUI communicate through defined protocols for query submission and result retrieval

## Operational Benefits
- **Scalability**: Index Server can process logs from multiple sources independently of GUI usage
- **Performance**: Separation allows indexing operations to continue without GUI interference
- **Flexibility**: Multiple GUI instances can connect to single Index Server for shared log analysis
