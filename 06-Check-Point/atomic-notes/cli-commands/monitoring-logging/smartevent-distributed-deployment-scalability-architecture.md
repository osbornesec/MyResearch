# SmartEvent Distributed Deployment Scalability Architecture

## Core Concept
Check Point SmartEvent supports both standalone and distributed deployment architectures, enabling organizations to scale from single-machine installations to multi-site deployments capable of processing millions of logs per day through distributed correlation units and load balancing.

## Deployment Options
- **Standalone Deployment**: All SmartEvent components (Correlation Unit, Server, Client) installed on single machine for smaller environments
- **Distributed Deployment**: Components spread across multiple machines and sites for higher logging volumes and geographic distribution
- **Multiple Correlation Units**: Each unit can analyze logs from multiple Log servers, enabling horizontal scaling
- **Load Distribution**: Processing load distributed across multiple correlation units to reduce network impact

## Scalability Characteristics
- **Volume Capacity**: Capable of managing millions of logs per day per correlation unit in large enterprise networks
- **Network Load Reduction**: Distributed architecture reduces centralized network bottlenecks
- **Geographic Distribution**: Supports multi-site deployments for global enterprise environments
- **Flexible Platform**: Scales from departmental to enterprise-wide security event correlation

## Integration Capabilities
- **SmartReporter Compatibility**: Can be installed together on same machine for unified reporting services
- **Security Management Integration**: Tight integration with Security Management Server architecture
- **Third-Party Device Support**: Processes logs from Check Point and third-party security devices
- **OPSEC Integration**: Supports external security device integration through OPSEC standards
