# CheckPoint SSL Network Extender Thin Client VPN

## Core Concept
CheckPoint SSL Network Extender (SNX) is a lightweight SSL VPN client that provides secure remote access to internal corporate resources through SSL tunneling technology, operating as an integral component of Mobile Access to deliver network-level and application-level connectivity based on user privileges and endpoint capabilities.

## Dual Operation Mode Architecture
SNX provides flexible connectivity through two distinct operational modes:
- **Network Mode**: Complete network-level access to all native applications through SSL tunneling, requiring administrator privileges for client installation and providing full internal network connectivity

- **Privilege-Based Deployment**: Automatic client deployment strategy selection based on user administrative privileges and security policies
- **Desktop Integration**: Network Mode client installation providing persistent desktop access and automatic connection capabilities
- **Browser-Based Operation**: Application Mode operation through web browser interface without local client installation requirements
- **Upgrade Management**: Automatic client upgrade procedures and version management through Mobile Access policy configuration

## Enterprise SSL VPN Management
