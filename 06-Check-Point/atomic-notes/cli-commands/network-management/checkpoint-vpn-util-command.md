# CheckPoint VPN Utility Command Framework

## Core Concept
The `vpn_util` command (likely referring to `vpn tu` - TunnelUtil) provides administrative control over VPN tunnels and Security Associations (SAs) on CheckPoint Security Gateways.

## Primary Functionality
**Tunnel Management**:
- List all current IKE (Internet Key Exchange) and IPsec Security Associations
- View SAs associated with specific VPN peers by IP address
- Interactive menu-driven interface for tunnel administration

**Administrative Operations**:
- Delete/reset IKE and IPsec SAs for specific peers or all connections
- Force tunnel re-establishment without gateway restart
- Clear stale or problematic tunnel sessions

**Troubleshooting Capabilities**:
- Diagnose VPN tunnel connectivity issues
- Reset stuck or failed tunnel connections
- Monitor tunnel status and health metrics

## Interactive Menu System
```bash
vpn tu  # Opens TunnelUtil interactive interface
```
Menu options include:
- View all Security Associations
- List SAs for specific peer IP
- Delete SAs for specific peer
- Reset all tunnel connections

## Operational Context
- Run from expert mode on Security Gateway
- Used for day-to-day VPN tunnel troubleshooting
- Critical tool for resolving tunnel connectivity issues
- May cause temporary disruption when deleting active SAs

## Use Cases
- Resolving stale tunnel connections
- Forcing tunnel re-negotiation
- Troubleshooting VPN connectivity problems
- Clearing failed authentication attempts
