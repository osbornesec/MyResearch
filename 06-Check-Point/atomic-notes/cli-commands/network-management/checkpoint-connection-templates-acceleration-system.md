# Check Point Connection Templates Acceleration System

## Core Concept
Connection Templates accelerate new connection establishment by creating reusable patterns for connections between identical source IP addresses, destination IP addresses, and destination ports, significantly reducing connection setup overhead.

## Technical Implementation
- **Creation Source**: Only Firewall component creates templates from active connections
- **Rule Base Dependency**: Templates generated according to current Rule Base configuration
- **Acceleration Scope**: Same source-to-destination-port communication patterns
- **Performance Impact**: Maximum acceleration for repetitive connection patterns

## Operational Characteristics
- **Template Lifecycle**: Created from active connections, reused for matching patterns
- **Security Integration**: Full Rule Base compliance maintained during acceleration
- **Resource Optimization**: Reduced CPU overhead for connection establishment
- **Scalability Enhancement**: Improved performance under high connection rates

## Limitations and Restrictions
- **Feature Compatibility**: Specific restrictions documented in sk32578
- **Rule Complexity**: Complex rules may limit template effectiveness
- **Traffic Patterns**: Most effective with predictable communication patterns
- **Memory Usage**: Template storage impacts system memory allocation
