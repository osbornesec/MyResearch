# Check Point License Management Framework

## Core Concept
Check Point license management uses the `cplic` command suite for centralized license administration, contract management, and feature enablement across Security Management Servers and Multi-Domain environments.

## License Operations
- **License Installation**: Add new licenses using `cplic put` with license file or activation key
- **License Verification**: Check license validity and feature availability with `cplic check`
- **Contract Management**: Handle support contracts and subscription renewals through `cplic contract`
- **Database Management**: Add, remove, and display license database entries using db commands
- **License Upgrade**: Migrate licenses to newer versions with `cplic upgrade`

## Administrative Commands
- **Database Operations**: `cplic db_add`, `cplic db_rm`, `cplic db_print` for license database management
- **License Display**: `cplic print` for comprehensive license information display
- **License Removal**: `cplic del` for removing specific licenses or features
- **License Retrieval**: `cplic get` for downloading licenses from Check Point servers
- **Feature Management**: Enable/disable specific product features through license control

## Multi-Domain Context
- Domain-specific license application using `mdsenv` context switching
- Centralized license management from Multi-Domain Server
- Per-domain license allocation and feature distribution
- Global license pool management with domain-specific entitlements

## Troubleshooting Integration
- License validation during policy installation failures
- Contract expiration monitoring and renewal workflows
- Feature availability verification for new deployments
- License conflict resolution in Multi-Domain environments
