# CheckPoint fwaccel dbg Command for SecureXL Debug Control

## Core Concept
The fwaccel dbg command provides comprehensive debugging control for Check Point SecureXL acceleration subsystem, enabling targeted diagnostic capabilities with customizable filters and module-specific debugging for performance troubleshooting and packet flow analysis.

## Debug Control Features
- **Single filter limitation**: Only one debug filter can be active at a time to prevent conflicts and ensure clear output
- **Wildcard support**: Uses asterisk (*) wildcards for IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol numbers for flexible filtering
- **Module-specific debugging**: Enables selective debugging of specific SecureXL components and subsystems
- **Flag-based control**: Granular debug flag configuration for targeted troubleshooting scope

## Command Syntax Structure
```
fwaccel dbg -m <module> -f <filter>
fwaccel dbg -x <debug_flags>
fwaccel dbg -d <on|off>
```

## Operational Characteristics
- **Performance impact**: Minimal system performance impact through targeted module debugging
- **Support integration**: Debug modules and flags typically configured per Check Point Support guidance
- **Filter granularity**: Supports filtering by source/destination IP, ports, and protocol parameters
- **Real-time analysis**: Provides live debug output for immediate troubleshooting feedback

## Integration Capabilities
- **fw monitor compatibility**: Works alongside fw monitor for comprehensive traffic analysis
- **SecureXL statistics**: Integrates with fwaccel stats for performance correlation
- **Connection tracking**: Complements fwaccel conns for connection-specific debugging
- **Violation analysis**: Supports packet acceleration violation troubleshooting

## Use Case Applications
- SecureXL performance degradation investigation
- Packet acceleration violation root cause analysis
- Template matching effectiveness evaluation
- DoS mitigation mechanism troubleshooting
