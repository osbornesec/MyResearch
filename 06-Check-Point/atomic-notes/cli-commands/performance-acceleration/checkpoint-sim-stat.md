# CheckPoint SecureXL sim stat Command

## Core Concept
The sim stat command displays SecureXL acceleration statistics, including current status, performance counters, and operational metrics for the acceleration subsystem.

## Command Syntax
```bash
sim stat
```

## Functionality
- **Performance Metrics**: Shows current SecureXL acceleration statistics and counters
- **Status Display**: Reports operational status of SecureXL acceleration components
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides current snapshot of acceleration performance
- **No Options Required**: Simple command execution without additional parameters

## Output Information
The command typically displays:
- SecureXL acceleration status (enabled/disabled)
- Current acceleration statistics and performance counters
- Interface acceleration status
- Template usage and processing statistics
- Connection acceleration metrics

## Usage Context
- **Performance Monitoring**: Regular checking of SecureXL acceleration effectiveness
- **Troubleshooting**: Baseline measurement for acceleration issues
- **Capacity Planning**: Understanding current acceleration utilization
- **Health Checks**: Verifying SecureXL operational status

## Monitoring Applications
