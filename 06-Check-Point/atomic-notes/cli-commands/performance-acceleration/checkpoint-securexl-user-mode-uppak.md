# CheckPoint SecureXL User Mode (UPPAK) Process-Based Acceleration

## Core Concept
SecureXL UPPAK (User Space Performance Pack) is Check Point's user-mode acceleration technology that runs SecureXL as processes in user space rather than kernel modules, providing enhanced stability and maintainability while maintaining performance benefits.

## Key Characteristics
- **User-space processing**: SecureXL runs as dedicated user processes
- **Process isolation**: Enhanced stability through process separation
- **Memory protection**: Better fault isolation and system stability
- **Service integration**: Integrates with Check Point service management
- **Debugging capabilities**: Enhanced troubleshooting and monitoring

## Architecture Benefits
- Improved system stability through process isolation
- Enhanced debugging and diagnostic capabilities
- Better integration with system monitoring tools
- Reduced kernel complexity and potential crash impact
- Maintained acceleration performance with improved reliability

## Technical Features
- Available starting from R81.20 via Jumbo Hotfix Accumulator
- Provides same acceleration benefits as KPPAK mode
- Enables advanced monitoring and performance analysis
- Supports all SecureXL acceleration features in user space

## Operational Considerations
- Requires R81.20 with specific hotfix accumulator
- Automatic mode detection via fwaccel stat command
- Compatible with existing SecureXL configurations
- Maintains backward compatibility with KPPAK deployments
