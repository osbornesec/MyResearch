# Check Point CoreXL FWAffinity Configuration System

## Core Concept
The fwaffinity.conf configuration file provides persistent CPU affinity settings for CoreXL environments, using structured line formats to define interface, daemon, and worker core assignments with automated application through the fwaffinity_apply script.

## Technical Implementation
- **Configuration File**: `$FWDIR/conf/fwaffinity.conf` stores static affinity rules
- **Line Format Types**: 
  - `i interface_name core_id` for interfaces
  - `n daemon_name core_id` for named processes  
  - `k worker_id core_id` for CoreXL instances
- **Application Script**: `$FWDIR/scripts/fwaffinity_apply` implements configuration changes
- **Persistent Settings**: Configuration survives system reboots and service restarts
- **Override Capability**: Manual `fw ctl affinity` commands can temporarily override file settings

## Research Context
Systematic configuration management for CoreXL CPU affinity settings, enabling reproducible and persistent performance optimization across multi-core firewall deployments.
