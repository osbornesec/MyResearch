# Check Point CoreXL Affinity CPU Assignment System

## Core Concept
The `fw ctl affinity` command framework provides granular control over CPU core assignments for interfaces, processes, and CoreXL Firewall instances, optimizing multi-core performance through precise resource allocation.

## Technical Implementation
- **Affinity Listing**: `-l` flag displays current CoreXL affinities with verbose options
- **Interface Assignment**: `-s -i Interface_Name CPU_ID` binds network interfaces to specific CPU cores
- **Process Control**: `-s -p PID CPU_IDs` sets process-to-core affinity mappings
- **Instance Management**: `-s -d -inst Instances_ranges -cpu CPU_ID_ranges` assigns FWK instances to cores
- **Range Support**: Accepts single IDs, ranges (0-5), or combinations (0-2 4) for flexible assignment

## Research Context
Critical CPU resource management system for CoreXL multi-core firewall optimization, preventing core contention and enabling optimal load distribution.
