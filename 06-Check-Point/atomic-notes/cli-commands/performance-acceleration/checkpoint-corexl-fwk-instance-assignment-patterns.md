# Check Point CoreXL FWK Instance Assignment Patterns

## Core Concept
CoreXL Firewall Kernel (FWK) instances can be assigned to CPU cores using flexible patterns, including individual instance targeting, bulk assignment operations, and comprehensive core allocation strategies.

## Technical Implementation
- **Instance-Specific**: `-inst Instances_ranges -cpu CPU_ID_ranges` assigns selected FWK instances to cores
- **Instance Lists**: `-inst 0 2 4` specifies discrete FWK instance numbers for assignment
- **Bulk Assignment**: `-fwkall Number_of_CPUs` assigns all FWK instances across specified CPU count
- **Core Ranges**: Supports range syntax for CPU assignment (e.g., 0-5, 0-2 4)
- **Strategic Distribution**: Enables optimized workload distribution across available processing cores

## Research Context
Essential pattern for optimizing CoreXL firewall performance through strategic FWK instance distribution, enabling fine-tuned control over multi-core packet processing workloads.
