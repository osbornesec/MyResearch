# Check Point CoreXL Firewall Worker Instance Architecture

## Core Concept
CoreXL Firewall Worker (FW) instances are replicated copies of the firewall kernel, each running on dedicated CPU cores to process packets in parallel, enabling multi-core scaling of firewall inspection capabilities.

## Technical Implementation
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple FW instances operate simultaneously on different CPU cores
- **Instance Isolation**: Each worker processes connections independently without shared state
- **Load Distribution**: SND (Secure Network Distributor) distributes packets among available FW instances
- **Core Assignment**: One FW instance typically assigned per available CPU core
- **Independent Operation**: Workers enforce security policy concurrently for maximum throughput

## Research Context
Fundamental building block of CoreXL multi-core firewall architecture, enabling horizontal scaling of packet inspection across modern multi-core processors.

## Source Quality
