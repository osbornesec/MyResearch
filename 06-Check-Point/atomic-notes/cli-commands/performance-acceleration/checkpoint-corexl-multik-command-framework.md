# Check Point CoreXL Multik Command Framework

## Core Concept
The `fw ctl multik` command provides centralized control over CoreXL Firewall instances, enabling administrators to start, stop, and monitor multi-core firewall worker processes across CPU cores.

## Technical Implementation
- **Instance Control**: `fw ctl multik start/stop` manages all or specific FW instances
- **Status Monitoring**: `fw ctl multik stat` displays CPU cores and CoreXL Firewall instance mapping
- **Targeted Management**: `fw -i Instance_ID ctl multik start/stop` controls individual workers
- **System Overview**: Provides unified interface for multi-core firewall architecture management

## Research Context
Essential command framework for CoreXL multi-core firewall architecture management, enabling precise control over distributed packet processing across CPU cores.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point ATRG CoreXL Technical Reference sk98737
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Cross-referenced with Check Point official documentation

## Connection Potential
- Links to CPU affinity management systems
