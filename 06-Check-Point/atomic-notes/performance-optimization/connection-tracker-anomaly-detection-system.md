# Connection Tracker Anomaly Detection System

## Core Concept

An intelligent background monitoring system that automatically captures detailed connection lifecycle data only when anomalies are detected, providing forensic-level analysis capabilities without impacting system performance during normal operations.

## Detection Architecture

### Anomaly-Driven Logging
- **Normal behavior**: Connection records discarded automatically
- **Anomaly detection**: Records preserved when errors, latency, or unusual patterns detected
- **Selective persistence**: Only problematic connections consume storage resources
- **Background operation**: Zero performance impact during normal traffic processing

### Data Collection Framework
**Automatic triggers for record preservation:**
- Connection processing errors
- Latency threshold violations  
- Protocol-specific anomalies
- Multi-layer complexity issues
- Resource consumption anomalies

## Implementation Architecture

### Operational Requirements
- **User space kernel**: Only available on user space firewall implementations
- **Connection-level operation**: Cannot capture packet-level issues before connection establishment
- **Background processing**: Analysis performed upon connection termination
- **Minimal resource usage**: Intelligent filtering prevents performance degradation

### Log File Management
```bash
# Log location
$FWDIR/log/tracker.log

# VSX environment
$FWDIR/log/CTX/CTX0000<VS_ID>/tracker.log

# Analysis with Python parser
$FWDIR/Python/bin/python3.7 $FWDIR/scripts/tracker_parser.py LOG_FILE
```

## Analysis Framework

### Connection Record Structure
**Header Information:**
- Source and destination IP addresses
- Connection start and end timestamps
- Number of collected tracking points
- Filter flags that triggered record preservation
- Irregular point index for anomaly identification
- Protocol and resource information

**Tracking Point Details:**
- Product-specific point identification
- Error and warning indicators
- Connectivity issue root cause analysis
- Certificate and authentication problems
- Performance bottleneck identification

### TAC Info Viewer (TIV) Integration
- **Decompressed output**: Human-readable connection analysis
- **Visual timeline**: Connection lifecycle visualization
- **Error highlighting**: Anomaly identification and context
- **Product correlation**: Issue attribution to specific security components

## Diagnostic Capabilities

### Investigation Applications
- **Connectivity troubleshooting**: Root cause analysis for connection failures
- **Latency investigation**: Performance bottleneck identification without reproduction
- **Flow comparison**: Baseline vs. problematic connection analysis
- **Multi-layer debugging**: Complex security stack issue resolution
- **Scenario reproduction**: Historical data for issue recreation

### User-Defined Filtering
- **Manual activation**: Custom filter criteria for specific scenarios
- **Performance impact**: User-defined filters may affect system performance
- **Targeted collection**: Selective monitoring for specific conditions
- **Manual deactivation**: Administrative control over collection scope

## Integration with Performance Investigation

### Anomaly Correlation
- **CPU utilization patterns**: Connection-level resource consumption analysis
- **Error propagation**: Multi-component failure analysis
- **Performance degradation**: Systematic bottleneck identification
- **Security stack interaction**: Cross-component issue resolution

## Research Context

Connection Tracker provides forensic-level network troubleshooting capabilities by intelligently capturing detailed connection data only when anomalies occur, enabling root cause analysis without the performance overhead of continuous detailed logging.
