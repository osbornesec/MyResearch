# CheckPoint Accelerated SYN Defender Anti-Flood Protection

## Core Concept
The Check Point Accelerated SYN Defender protects Security Gateways against TCP SYN flood attacks by using SYN cookies to prevent excessive half-open TCP connections, acting as a TCP proxy that validates connection attempts before establishing server-side connections.

## Attack Protection Mechanism
- **SYN cookie validation**: Uses cryptographic cookies in TCP sequence numbers
- **Connection state deferral**: Avoids maintaining state until connection validation
- **Proxy-based operation**: Acts as intermediary between client and server
- **Sequence number adjustment**: Maintains proper TCP sequencing throughout connection
- **Threshold-based activation**: Triggers under suspected attack conditions

## TCP Flow Process
1. **Client SYN reception**: Intercepts initial connection request
2. **Cookie generation**: Responds with SYN+ACK containing validation cookie
3. **Client ACK validation**: Verifies cookie legitimacy in client response
4. **Server connection initiation**: Establishes server-side connection after validation
5. **Sequence adjustment**: Maintains TCP sequence synchronization for connection lifetime

## SecureXL Integration
- **Hardware acceleration**: SYN packet processing handled by SecureXL
- **Performance optimization**: Reduces Security Gateway load during attacks
- **Connection establishment**: Firewall processes handle post-validation connections
- **Scalable protection**: Effective against high-volume SYN flood attacks

## Configuration and Management
- **fwaccel synatk commands**: Direct configuration of SYN defender parameters
- **IPS integration**: SmartConsole SYN Attack protection configuration
- **Threshold tuning**: Adjustable activation thresholds and protection levels
- **Interface protection**: Configurable for all interfaces or external only
