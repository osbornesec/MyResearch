# CoreXL Firewall Worker Instance Architecture

## Core Concept

CoreXL implements a multi-core architecture using Firewall Worker (FWK) instances that distribute packet processing across multiple CPU cores, with each instance handling specific network interfaces and traffic flows through configurable CPU affinity assignments and load balancing algorithms.

## Technical Implementation

### Instance Management Framework
- **FWK Instance Control**: Each instance assigned specific CPU core(s) and network interfaces
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Instance count adjustable based on hardware capabilities and license
- **Affinity Assignment**: Precise CPU-to-instance mapping for optimal performance
- **Interface Binding**: Network interfaces bound to specific FWK instances

### Command Framework
- **`fw ctl multik`**: Master control for CoreXL instance management
- **`fw ctl affinity`**: CPU affinity configuration and monitoring
- **Instance Targeting**: `-i Instance_ID` for specific instance operations
- **System-wide Control**: Unified start/stop operations across all instances

## Architecture Components

### Instance Distribution Patterns
- **Interface-Based Assignment**: Each network interface assigned to specific FWK instance
- **CPU Core Mapping**: One-to-one or many-to-one CPU-to-instance relationships
- **Virtual Device Support**: VSX environments with per-VSID instance allocation
- **Load Balancing**: Traffic distribution algorithms across available instances

### Performance Optimization
- **CPU Isolation**: Dedicated CPU cores prevent context switching overhead
- **Memory Locality**: NUMA-aware memory allocation for optimal performance
- **Interrupt Handling**: Network interrupts directed to appropriate CPU cores
- **Cache Efficiency**: CPU cache optimization through consistent core assignment

## Configuration Methodology

### Affinity Configuration Syntax
```bash
# View current affinity assignments
fw ctl affinity -l -v

# Set interface affinity to specific CPU
fw ctl affinity -s -i Interface_Name CPU_ID

# Configure FWK instance affinity
fw ctl affinity -s -d -inst Instance_ranges -cpu CPU_ID_ranges

# VSX-specific affinity (with VSID ranges)
fw ctl affinity -s -d -pname Daemon_Name -vsid VSID_ranges -cpu CPU_ID_ranges
```

### Best Practice Patterns
- **CPU Core Separation**: Isolate management and data plane processing
- **Interface Balancing**: Distribute high-traffic interfaces across instances
- **NUMA Optimization**: Align instance placement with memory topology
- **Factory Reset**: VSX affinity reset procedures for troubleshooting

## Operational Monitoring

### Status Verification
- **Instance Health**: Monitor FWK instance operational status
- **CPU Utilization**: Per-core utilization monitoring and alerting
- **Traffic Distribution**: Verify balanced load across instances
- **Performance Metrics**: Throughput and latency measurement per instance

### Troubleshooting Framework
- **Instance Debugging**: Individual instance restart and debugging procedures
- **Affinity Conflicts**: Resolution of CPU assignment conflicts
- **Performance Analysis**: Bottleneck identification and optimization
- **Configuration Validation**: Verify optimal affinity assignments
