# Check Point SAM Rules Creation Workflow

## Core Concept

Suspicious Activity Monitoring (SAM) rules provide immediate threat blocking capability without requiring full security policy installation, accessible through version-specific SmartView Monitor integration workflows for rapid security response.

## R8x Version Access Workflow

### Primary Access Path
1. **SmartConsole Connection**: Connect to Security Management Server/Domain Management Server
2. **Navigation**: LOGS & MONITOR → Application main navigation pane
3. **Tab Selection**: Navigate to New Tab section
4. **External Apps**: Click Tunnel & User Monitoring
5. **Monitor Launch**: SmartView Monitor GUI opens automatically
6. **Rule Access**: Suspicious Activity Rules button or Tools menu option

### Interface Components
- **Block Suspicious Activity Window**: Primary configuration interface
- **Immediate Enforcement**: Rules applied without Install Policy requirement
- **Criteria Configuration**: Source/destination/service-based blocking flexibility

## R7x Version Access Workflow

### Direct Access Method
1. **Direct Connection**: Connect directly to Security Management Server/Domain Management Server
2. **Tools Navigation**: Tools menu → Suspicious Activity Rules
3. **Rule Creation**: Add button in Enforced Suspicious Activity Rules window

### Legacy Interface Benefits
- **Simplified Access**: Direct menu navigation without tab switching
- **Immediate Configuration**: Streamlined rule creation process
- **Compatibility**: Consistent functionality across versions

## Rule Creation Interface Framework

### Configuration Components
- **Block Suspicious Activity Window**: Primary rule definition interface
- **Match Criteria**: Source, destination, service-based targeting options
- **Action Definition**: Blocking behavior and response configuration
- **Expiration Management**: Time-based rule lifecycle control

### Immediate Response Characteristics
- **No Policy Installation**: Rules applied instantly without full policy deployment
- **Dynamic Enforcement**: Real-time security response capability
- **Resource Awareness**: CPU consumption monitoring and optimization

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Management
- **CPU Impact**: SAM rules consume Security Gateway CPU resources
- **Lifecycle Management**: Set appropriate expiration times for investigation balance
- **Active Rule Monitoring**: Keep only necessary SAM rules active for performance
- **Investigation Timeframe**: Balance security response with performance impact

### Operational Best Practices
- **Expiration Strategy**: Set timeframes allowing adequate investigation without permanent impact
- **Rule Cleanup**: Regular review and removal of unnecessary active rules
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor CPU resource consumption on Security Gateway

## API Integration Opportunities

- **Automated Rule Creation**: Programmatic SAM rule generation from SIEM integration
- **Dynamic Response**: API-driven threat response based on real-time analysis
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automated rule expiration and cleanup workflows
- **Integration Framework**: SOAR platform integration for orchestrated response
