# Check Point Logging Architecture API Integration

## Core Concept
Check Point centralized logging architecture provides comprehensive API interfaces for log collection, Multi-Domain tenant isolation, LEA (Log Export API) integration, and external log source management, enabling programmatic security event analysis and compliance reporting.

## Log Management APIs
- **Log Collection API**: Centralized log ingestion from distributed security gateways with real-time streaming and batch processing capabilities
- **Multi-Domain Logging API**: Tenant-aware log separation and access control with domain-specific query interfaces and data isolation
- **LEA Integration API**: External log export framework supporting multiple formats (JSON, CEF, LEEF) with configurable filtering and transformation
- **Log Storage API**: Scalable log storage management with compression, archival, and retention policy enforcement
- **Query Interface API**: High-performance log search and analytics with full-text indexing and structured query capabilities

## Security Event API Patterns
- **Real-Time Event Streaming**: WebSocket-based live security event distribution with filtering and routing capabilities
- **Event Correlation API**: Automated security event correlation and pattern recognition with configurable rule engines
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: API-driven threat indicator enrichment and contextual analysis integration
- **Incident Response API**: Automated incident creation and escalation based on log analysis and security event correlation
- **Compliance Reporting API**: Automated regulatory compliance report generation with customizable templates and scheduling

## Integration Architecture Patterns
- **SIEM Integration API**: Standardized interfaces for security information and event management platform integration
- **Log Forwarding API**: Reliable log delivery to external systems with retry mechanisms and duplicate detection
- **Data Pipeline API**: Stream processing integration for real-time log analysis and transformation workflows
- **Archive Management API**: Long-term log storage and retrieval with compression and metadata indexing
- **Performance Optimization API**: Log processing performance monitoring and optimization with throughput analytics

## Multi-Domain Management Patterns
- **Tenant Isolation API**: Domain-specific log access control with strict data separation and query sandboxing
- **Cross-Domain Analytics API**: Authorized cross-tenant security analysis with privacy protection and access auditing
- **Resource Allocation API**: Per-domain log storage quotas and performance resource management
- **Administrative API**: Multi-Domain log server configuration and maintenance with centralized management
- **Audit Trail API**: Administrative action logging and compliance tracking across all domains

## External Integration Frameworks
- **REST API Gateway**: Unified API access point for external log consumers with authentication and rate limiting
- **Webhook Delivery API**: Event-driven log notification system with configurable triggers and destinations
- **Data Export API**: Bulk log export capabilities with multiple format support and scheduled delivery
- **Analytics Platform Integration**: Native integration with business intelligence and analytics platforms
- **Cloud Service Integration**: Direct integration with cloud-based log management and security analytics services
