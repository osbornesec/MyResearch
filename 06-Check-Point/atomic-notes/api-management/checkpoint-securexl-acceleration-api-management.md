# Check Point SecureXL Acceleration API Management

## Core Concept
Check Point SecureXL hardware acceleration provides programmatic management interfaces for kernel-mode (KPPAK) and user-mode (UPPAK) acceleration, enabling API-driven performance optimization, connection template management, and DoS protection configuration.

## Acceleration Management APIs
- **Mode Configuration API**: Programmatic switching between KPPAK (kernel-mode) and UPPAK (user-mode) acceleration with validation and rollback capabilities
- **Connection Template API**: RESTful management of pre-computed forwarding decisions and connection state optimization rules
- **Policy Installation API**: Accelerated rule compilation and deployment through optimized API endpoints with progress tracking
- **Feature Control API**: Selective acceleration enablement for specific traffic types, protocols, and security inspection capabilities
- **Performance Analytics API**: Real-time acceleration statistics, template hit rates, and bypass efficiency metrics

## Traffic Optimization API Patterns
- **Packet Flow Analysis API**: Programmatic access to slow-path vs fast-path processing statistics with detailed traffic categorization
- **Template Caching API**: Connection decision caching management with TTL configuration and cache invalidation patterns
- **DoS Mitigation API**: Rate limiting configuration and SYN attack protection with granular control parameters and threshold management
- **Multi-Core Integration API**: CoreXL coordination interfaces for parallel processing optimization and load distribution
- **Traffic Classification API**: Automated traffic type identification and acceleration eligibility determination

## Configuration Management Patterns
- **Dynamic Reconfiguration API**: Runtime acceleration parameter adjustment without service interruption
- **Debug Interface API**: Comprehensive logging and analysis endpoints for performance tuning and troubleshooting
- **Health Check API**: Acceleration system health monitoring with automatic failover to non-accelerated processing
- **Capacity Management API**: Resource utilization tracking and automatic scaling recommendations
- **Audit Trail API**: Configuration change logging and compliance reporting for acceleration management operations

## Performance Optimization Integration
- **Baseline Establishment API**: Automated performance baseline creation and comparison frameworks
- **Bottleneck Detection API**: Algorithmic identification of acceleration limitations and optimization recommendations
- **Predictive Scaling API**: Performance trend analysis with proactive acceleration capacity management
- **A/B Testing API**: Controlled acceleration configuration testing with statistical significance analysis
- **Optimization Automation API**: Self-tuning acceleration parameters based on traffic patterns and performance metrics

## Security Integration Patterns
- **Security Policy API**: Integration between acceleration and security inspection with policy compliance validation
- **Threat Protection API**: Coordination between hardware acceleration and threat prevention capabilities
- **Inspection Bypass API**: Intelligent security inspection bypass for trusted traffic with risk assessment
- **Compliance Monitoring API**: Ensuring acceleration configurations meet security policy requirements
- **Incident Response API**: Automatic acceleration suspension during security incidents with forensic data preservation
