# Checkpoint Mobile Access Blade Enterprise Architecture

## Core Concept
Check Point Mobile Access Software Blade provides enterprise-grade remote access via dual VPN protocols (Layer-3 VPN and SSL VPN), enabling secure connectivity to email, calendar, contacts and corporate applications from smartphones, tablets, and PCs over Internet infrastructure.

## API Integration Architecture
- **VPN Protocol APIs**: Layer-3 VPN and SSL VPN protocol interfaces
- **Device Management APIs**: Smartphone, tablet, and PC platform support
- **Application Access APIs**: Email, calendar, contacts, and corporate application integration
- **Security Gateway APIs**: Internet connectivity with enterprise security controls
- **Authentication APIs**: Integrated realm-based authentication with multi-factor support

## Enterprise Deployment Benefits
- **Market Responsiveness**: Addresses growing remote access demands
- **Device Proliferation Support**: Universal wireless device compatibility
- **Workforce Mobility**: Enables work-from-home and mobile scenarios
- **Universal Access**: Overcomes traditional IPSec VPN limitations
- **Port Optimization**: Resolves connectivity issues with non-standard ports

## Implementation Context
Mobile Access Blade addresses traditional IPSec VPN limitations including requirement for preinstalled "fat" client software and connectivity restrictions from different local networks using ports other than standard HTTP/HTTPS (80/443).
