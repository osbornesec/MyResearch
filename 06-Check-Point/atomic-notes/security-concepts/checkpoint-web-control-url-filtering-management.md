# CheckPoint Web Control URL Filtering Management

## Core Concept
CheckPoint Web Control provides comprehensive URL filtering and web access management capabilities that work in conjunction with Application Control to restrict access to specific websites, web categories, and online resources based on user identity, group membership, and organizational security policies for enhanced web security and productivity management.

## URL Filtering Architecture Framework
Web Control operates through sophisticated filtering mechanisms:
- **Category-Based Filtering**: Comprehensive web content categorization enabling policy control based on website categories and content types
- **URL-Specific Control**: Granular control over individual websites and web resources through explicit URL allow/block lists
