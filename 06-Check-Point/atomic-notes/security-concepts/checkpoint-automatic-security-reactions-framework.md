# CheckPoint Automatic Security Reactions Framework

## Core Concept

Automatic Reactions enable immediate, programmatic responses to security events without human intervention through configurable action templates that execute when specific event conditions are met.

## Reaction Types

**Mail Reactions** - Automated email notifications to security teams with event details and context, supporting dynamic field inclusion from the event data.

**SNMP Trap Reactions** - Generate SNMP traps for integration with network monitoring systems, including customizable event field mappings for comprehensive alerting.

**Block Source Reactions** - Automatically instruct Security Gateways to block traffic from identified threat sources for configurable timeframes, providing immediate threat containment.

**Block Event Activity Reactions** - Block distributed attacks emanating from multiple sources or targeting multiple destinations, effective against coordinated attack patterns.

**External Script Reactions** - Execute custom scripts that can access and manipulate SmartEvent data, enabling integration with external security tools and custom response workflows.

## Implementation Characteristics

Reactions are assigned to specific event definitions with configurable parameters including timeframes, working hours restrictions, and exception handling. The framework supports complex conditional logic and can incorporate event field data into reaction parameters.

## Operational Value

Reduces security incident response time from minutes or hours to seconds while ensuring consistent application of security policies across the entire infrastructure.

## Connection Potential

Integrates with SIEM systems, security orchestration platforms, incident response playbooks, and automated threat intelligence feeds for comprehensive security automation.
