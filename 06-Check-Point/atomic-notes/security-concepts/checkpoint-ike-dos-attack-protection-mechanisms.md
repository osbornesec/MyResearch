# Check Point IKE DoS Attack Protection Mechanisms

## Core Concept
Check Point IKE (Internet Key Exchange) DoS Attack Protection implements rate limiting and resource management controls to prevent denial-of-service attacks against VPN infrastructure by restricting the number of concurrent IKE negotiations and implementing intelligent throttling mechanisms.

## Protection Mechanisms

### Rate Limiting Controls
- **Connection Rate Limiting**: Maximum IKE negotiations per second from single source
- **Concurrent Session Limits**: Total active IKE sessions per peer and globally
- **Memory Threshold Protection**: Dynamic limits based on available system resources
- **CPU Load Balancing**: IKE processing distribution across available cores

### Attack Detection Methods
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identification of abnormal IKE request patterns
- **Source IP Analysis**: Rate tracking and blacklisting of malicious sources
- **Resource Monitoring**: Real-time assessment of system resource consumption
- **Behavioral Analytics**: Detection of unusual IKE negotiation behaviors

## Advanced Configuration Options
- **Pre-Authentication Protection**: Filtering before resource-intensive operations
- **Negotiation Timeout Controls**: Aggressive timeout for incomplete exchanges
- **Priority-Based Processing**: Preferential handling of legitimate traffic
- **Logging and Alerting**: Comprehensive attack detection reporting

## Integration with VPN Architecture
- **Load Balancing Coordination**: Distribution of IKE load across cluster members
- **High Availability Sync**: Coordinated protection state across HA pairs
- **Policy Integration**: Security rules aware of IKE protection status
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimal impact on legitimate VPN traffic
