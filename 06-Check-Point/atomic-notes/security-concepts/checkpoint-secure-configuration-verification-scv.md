# Check Point Secure Configuration Verification (SCV)

## Core Concept
Secure Configuration Verification (SCV) is a Check Point technology that validates remote client security status before allowing VPN connectivity, ensuring that connecting endpoints meet organizational security policies through automated security assessment and enforcement.

## SCV Workflow Architecture

### Client-Side Assessment
- **SCV Plugin Installation**: Automated deployment of security verification plugins
- **Real-Time Checks**: Continuous monitoring of client security status
- **Policy Compliance**: Verification against organizational security standards
- **Remediation Guidance**: Automated instructions for security compliance

### Server-Side Policy Management
- **SCV Policy Configuration**: Centralized security policy definition on management server
- **Dynamic Policy Updates**: Real-time policy distribution to VPN clients
- **Compliance Enforcement**: Access control based on security verification results
- **Audit and Reporting**: Comprehensive logging of compliance status

## Security Verification Components
- **Antivirus Status**: Verification of antivirus software presence and updates
- **Firewall Configuration**: Assessment of client firewall settings
- **Operating System Patches**: Validation of security update installation
- **Third-Party Security Tools**: Integration with external security solutions

## Access Control Integration
- **Conditional Access**: VPN connectivity based on compliance status
- **Quarantine Mechanisms**: Isolation of non-compliant clients
- **Remediation Workflows**: Automated security fixing processes
- **Policy-Aware Rules**: Security gateway rules based on SCV results
