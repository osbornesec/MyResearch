# Mail Transfer Agent Threat Emulation Integration

## Core Concept
Check Point Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) enables Security Gateways to manage SMTP traffic emulation by handling connection timeouts during file analysis, completing connections with source servers independently of emulation duration, and ensuring secure email delivery after threat analysis completion.

## MTA Deployment Advantages
- **TLS Traffic Decryption**: Enables Threat Emulation to decrypt encrypted emails for comprehensive analysis
- **Connection Timeout Prevention**: Completes and closes connections with source email servers before lengthy emulation processes
- **SMTP Traffic Control**: Supports Threat Emulation profile settings that prevent direct SMTP traffic flow
- **Malicious Attachment Removal**: Automatically removes identified malicious attachments while delivering safe email content

## Operational Workflow
- **Connection Management**: MTA accepts email from source server and closes connection immediately
- **File Emulation Process**: Sends attachments for threat analysis while maintaining email flow control
- **Safe Delivery**: Forwards clean emails to internal mail servers after emulation completion
- **Fail Mode Protection**: Prevents email timeout scenarios that would trigger potentially unsafe fail mode operations

## Security Benefits
- **Enhanced Analysis Time**: Allows complete file emulation without source server connection constraints
- **TLS Inspection**: Enables deep inspection of encrypted email communications
- **Attachment Sanitization**: Removes threats while preserving legitimate email communication
- **Traffic Isolation**: Creates security boundary between external and internal email infrastructure
