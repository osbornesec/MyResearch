# CloudGuard CNAPP Unified Cloud-Native Protection Platform

## Core Concept

Check Point CloudGuard CNAPP represents a paradigm shift in cloud security by integrating Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), Container Workload Protection (CWPP), Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM), and Cloud Detection and Response (CDR) into a unified platform. This code-to-cloud protection framework operates through 52 specialized security engines protecting over 821 million cloud assets daily across multi-cloud environments.
