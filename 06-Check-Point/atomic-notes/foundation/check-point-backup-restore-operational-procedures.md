# Check Point Backup Restore Operational Procedures

## Core Concept
Check Point backup and restore operations provide systematic data protection through Gaia snapshots, configuration database backups, and policy export/import procedures, supporting disaster recovery, system migration, and configuration version control with automated scheduling and verification capabilities.

## Backup Types
- **Gaia Snapshots**: Complete system state capture including OS configuration, software packages, and system files
- **Configuration Database**: Security Management Server policy and object database backup with incremental and full options
- **System-Level Backup**: Operating system configuration, certificates, and administrative settings preservation
- **Log Backup**: Historical security event data and correlation information backup for compliance and analysis

## Backup Procedures
- **Scheduled Automation**: Automated backup execution with configurable retention policies and storage management
- **Manual Backup**: On-demand snapshot creation for pre-change system state preservation
- **Multi-Domain Backup**: Tenant-specific backup with domain isolation and cross-domain coordination
- **Incremental Backup**: Delta-based backup for efficient storage utilization and rapid execution

## Restore Operations
- **Complete System Restore**: Full system recovery from snapshot with hardware compatibility verification
- **Selective Restoration**: Granular recovery of specific configuration elements or policy components
- **Database Import**: Policy and object restoration with version compatibility and dependency validation
- **Migration Support**: Cross-platform restore capabilities for hardware refresh and system consolidation

## Verification Framework
- **Backup Integrity**: Checksum validation and corruption detection for backup reliability assurance
- **Restore Testing**: Non-production validation of backup completeness and restore procedures
- **Recovery Time Objectives**: Performance benchmarking and optimization for business continuity requirements
- **Documentation Standards**: Backup catalog maintenance and recovery procedure documentation
