# Check Point Multi-Domain Logging Architecture

## Core Concept
Check Point Multi-Domain logging architecture provides centralized log collection with tenant isolation through Domain Dedicated Log Servers, Multi-Domain Log Servers, and Global Domain integration, supporting enterprise-scale multi-tenant security management with separate storage, retention, and access control per domain.

## Architecture Components
- **Multi-Domain Log Server**: Centralized logging infrastructure supporting multiple security domains with unified management
- **Domain Dedicated Log Server**: Tenant-specific log servers providing complete domain isolation and dedicated resources
- **Global Domain Integration**: Cross-domain log correlation and reporting while maintaining tenant data segregation
- **Dynamic Log Distribution**: Intelligent log routing based on domain membership and configured distribution policies

## Tenant Isolation Mechanisms
- **Domain-Specific Storage**: Separate log databases and file systems preventing cross-tenant data access
- **Access Control Integration**: Role-based access controls aligned with domain membership and administrative privileges
- **Resource Allocation**: Dedicated CPU, memory, and storage resources per domain preventing resource contention
- **Network Segmentation**: Logical network isolation for log transmission and management traffic

## Deployment Patterns
- **Centralized Architecture**: Single Multi-Domain Log Server handling all tenant log collection and storage
- **Distributed Architecture**: Multiple Domain Dedicated Log Servers with centralized coordination and reporting
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combination of shared and dedicated resources based on tenant requirements and compliance needs
- **Scalable Deployment**: Horizontal scaling through additional log servers and load distribution mechanisms

## Management Integration
- **Multi-Domain Server Coordination**: Integration with Multi-Domain Security Management Server for policy and configuration distribution
- **SmartEvent Multi-Domain**: Cross-domain event correlation with tenant isolation and aggregated threat intelligence
- **Reporting Consolidation**: Unified reporting infrastructure supporting both domain-specific and cross-domain analytics
- **Administrative Delegation**: Domain-specific administrative access with global oversight and coordination capabilities

## Connection Potential
Links to multi-tenant security architecture, enterprise domain management, compliance frameworks, scalable logging infrastructure, and security event correlation systems.
