# Check Point Deployment Scenario Selection Framework

## Core Concept
Check Point deployment scenarios follow structured patterns based on architectural requirements, with distributed deployment separating management and gateway functions, standalone deployment co-locating functions, and management high availability providing redundancy through synchronized server pairs.

## Deployment Patterns
- **Distributed Deployment**: Security Management Server and Security Gateway installed on separate computers with network connectivity
- **Standalone Deployment**: Security Management Server and Security Gateway co-located on same computer for simplified administration
- **Management High Availability**: Primary and Secondary Security Management Servers with database synchronization and failover capabilities
- **Multi-Domain Architecture**: Centralized multi-tenant management with domain isolation and distributed policy administration

## Selection Criteria
- **Network Topology**: Physical and logical network segmentation requirements
- **Performance Requirements**: Traffic throughput and management server load considerations
- **Redundancy Needs**: High availability and business continuity requirements
- **Administrative Scope**: Single domain vs multi-tenant management complexity
- **Resource Constraints**: Hardware capacity and infrastructure limitations

## Implementation Considerations
- **Network Connectivity**: Direct or indirect connections between management and gateway components
- **Database Synchronization**: Manual or scheduled database replication for high availability scenarios
- **Policy Distribution**: Centralized policy compilation and distributed enforcement patterns
- **Licensing**: Per-deployment licensing requirements and feature enablement
