# Check Point Log Retention Storage Management

## Core Concept
Check Point log retention and storage management employs optimization algorithms for automatic disk space management, deleting oldest logs based on configurable thresholds, with daily retention policies, storage quotas, and intelligent archival strategies supporting compliance requirements and operational efficiency.

## Storage Optimization
- **Automatic Deletion**: Oldest logs and events removed when database size exceeds configured thresholds
- **Disk Space Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring with minimum disk space enforcement (default 5000 MB or 15% available space)
- **Resource Management**: System resource optimization balancing storage efficiency with performance requirements
- **Index Management**: Log index files stored separately with automated cleanup and maintenance procedures

## Retention Policies
- **Daily Log Retention**: Configurable retention periods based on log type, compliance requirements, and storage capacity
- **Compliance Integration**: Regulatory requirement support with immutable storage options and audit trail preservation
- **Hierarchical Storage**: Automated migration from high-performance to archival storage based on age and access patterns
- **Compression Strategies**: Log compression algorithms reducing storage footprint while maintaining searchability

## Multi-Domain Management
- **Tenant Isolation**: Domain-specific log storage with separate retention policies and access controls
- **Cross-Domain Correlation**: Centralized logging architecture supporting multi-tenant event correlation
- **Dedicated Log Servers**: Specialized log servers with domain-specific or shared storage architectures
- **Storage Federation**: Distributed storage across multiple servers with load balancing and redundancy

## Performance Considerations
- **Index Optimization**: Automatic index maintenance and optimization for rapid log search and retrieval
- **Storage Tiering**: Hot, warm, and cold storage tiers based on log age and access frequency patterns
- **Bandwidth Management**: Log transmission rate limiting and prioritization for network efficiency
- **Query Performance**: Optimized storage layouts supporting high-performance log analysis and reporting
