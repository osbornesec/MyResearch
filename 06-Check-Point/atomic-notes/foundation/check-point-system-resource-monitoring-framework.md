# Check Point System Resource Monitoring Framework

## Core Concept
Check Point system resource monitoring framework provides comprehensive real-time and historical monitoring through CPView utility, SNMP integration, log analysis, and performance metric collection, supporting proactive system administration, troubleshooting, and capacity management with automated alerting and reporting capabilities.

## Monitoring Components
- **CPView Real-Time Monitoring**: Interactive text-based utility displaying CPU, memory, disk space, and Software Blade performance statistics
- **SNMP Integration**: Standards-based monitoring integration with enterprise network management systems and third-party monitoring platforms
- **System Logging**: Comprehensive system and security event logging with severity classification and automated analysis
- **Performance Counters**: Detailed performance metrics collection for traffic processing, acceleration, and security inspection operations

## Resource Categories
- **System Resources**: CPU utilization per core, memory consumption, disk space usage, and network interface statistics
- **Security Performance**: Traffic throughput, connection rates, inspection efficiency, and threat detection performance
- **Acceleration Metrics**: SecureXL acceleration ratios, template hit rates, and hardware acceleration efficiency
- **Service Health**: Process status, service availability, daemon health, and cluster synchronization status

## Monitoring Interfaces
- **Interactive Console**: CPView text-based interface with navigation menus and real-time data refresh capabilities
- **Command-Line Tools**: CLI-based monitoring commands for scripting and automation integration
- **Web Portal Integration**: Gaia Portal monitoring widgets and system information displays
- **API Integration**: Programmatic access to monitoring data for custom applications and integration platforms

## Alerting and Automation
- **Threshold-Based Alerting**: Configurable performance thresholds with automated notification and escalation procedures
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical data analysis identifying performance patterns and capacity planning requirements
- **Automated Response**: Scripted responses to common performance issues and resource constraint conditions
- **Report Generation**: Scheduled performance reports supporting operational review and capacity planning initiatives
