# CoreXL Performance Architecture Framework

## Core Concept

A multi-core firewall architecture that distributes network connections across multiple CPU cores through dedicated firewall instances, with comprehensive affinity management and load balancing capabilities for optimal performance scaling.

## Architecture Components

### CoreXL Instance Management
- **Firewall Instances**: Dedicated firewall processes assigned to specific CPU cores
- **Connection Distribution**: Each connection mapped to single firewall instance based on hash algorithm
- **Instance Isolation**: Independent processing prevents single connection from affecting others
- **Scalable Processing**: Linear performance scaling with additional CPU cores

### Core Management Commands
```bash
# Instance status and statistics
fw ctl multik stat

# Start/stop CoreXL
fw ctl multik start
fw ctl multik stop

# Instance-specific control
fw -i INSTANCE_ID ctl multik start
fw -i INSTANCE_ID ctl multik stop
```

## Affinity Management System

### Affinity Control Framework
```bash
# View current affinities
fw ctl affinity -l
fw ctl affinity -l -a      # All affinities
fw ctl affinity -l -v      # Verbose output
fw ctl affinity -l -x      # Extended output with filtering
```

### Affinity Configuration Options
- **Interface affinity**: Bind specific interfaces to CPU cores
- **Process affinity**: Assign processes to specific cores
- **Instance affinity**: Control firewall instance to core mapping
- **Virtual device affinity**: VSX environment core assignment

### Advanced Affinity Commands
```bash
# Set interface affinity (single core only)
fw ctl affinity -s -i INTERFACE_NAME CPU_ID

# Set process affinity
fw ctl affinity -s -p PID CPU_IDs

# Set daemon affinity by name
fw ctl affinity -s -d -pname DAEMON_NAME -cpu CPU_ID_RANGES

# Set firewall instance affinity
fw ctl affinity -s -d -inst INSTANCE_RANGES -cpu CPU_ID_RANGES
```

## Performance Optimization Framework

### Load Distribution Analysis
- **Connection tracking**: Monitor connections per instance
- **CPU utilization**: Track per-core processing load
- **Traffic patterns**: Analyze distribution effectiveness
- **Bottleneck identification**: Detect instance-specific performance issues

### VSX Environment Considerations
- **VSID-specific affinity**: Virtual system core assignment
- **Multi-context operation**: Independent virtual firewall management
- **Resource isolation**: Dedicated core allocation per virtual system
- **Factory defaults**: VSX affinity reset capabilities

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Status Validation Commands
```bash
# Core licensing information
fw -d ctl affinity -corelicnum

# Extended filtering with VSID and CPU ranges
fw ctl affinity -l -x -vsid VSID_RANGES -cpu CPU_ID_RANGES

# Output to file for analysis
fw ctl affinity -l -x -flags o
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Instance utilization**: Per-core CPU consumption tracking
- **Connection distribution**: Hash algorithm effectiveness analysis  
- **Processing efficiency**: Throughput per core measurement
- **Resource utilization**: Memory and processing capacity assessment

## Research Context

CoreXL provides the fundamental architecture for scaling firewall performance across multiple CPU cores while maintaining connection state consistency and enabling granular performance optimization through affinity management.
