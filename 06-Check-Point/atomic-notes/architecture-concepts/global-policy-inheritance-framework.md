# Global Policy Inheritance Framework

## Core Concept
CheckPoint Global Policy Inheritance enables centralized security policy distribution through hierarchical rule composition, dynamic object resolution, and policy layer inheritance, allowing organizations to maintain consistent security standards while enabling domain-specific customization.

## Policy Hierarchy Architecture

### **Global Domain Components**
- **Global Access Control Policy**: Universal firewall, application control, URL filtering, and VPN rules
- **Global Threat Prevention Policy**: IPS, Anti-Bot, Anti-Virus, and threat protection rules
- **Global Objects**: Centrally managed system objects and configuration settings
- **Policy Layers**: Hierarchical rule composition with inheritance and override capabilities

### **Dynamic Object Framework**
- **Dynamic Global Network Objects**: Template objects resolved to local equivalents during assignment
- **Dynamic Objects**: IP address assignment at Security Gateway level during policy installation
- **Global Suffix Convention**: `_global` naming convention for automated object resolution
- **Template Rules**: Policy rules using dynamic objects for flexible domain application

### **Assignment and Distribution**
- **Global Assignments**: Selective distribution of global configurations to specific domains
- **Policy Installation**: Automated deployment to Security Gateways with local object resolution
- **ICA Certificate Distribution**: Automatic certificate exchange for VPN community participation
- **Error Handling**: Assignment error detection and remediation workflows

## Advanced Enhancement Opportunities

### **AI-Enhanced Policy Management**
- **Intelligent Policy Distribution**: Machine learning to optimize policy assignment based on domain characteristics
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automated detection and resolution of policy conflicts between global and local rules
- **Policy Optimization**: Analysis of policy effectiveness and automated rule consolidation
- **Compliance Validation**: Automated verification of policy adherence to regulatory requirements

### **Enterprise Integration Patterns**
- **GitOps Policy Management**: Version control integration for policy lifecycle management
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated policy provisioning and configuration management
- **API-Driven Assignment**: Programmatic global assignment management for enterprise automation
- **Multi-Cloud Policy Sync**: Cross-platform policy synchronization for hybrid environments

## Permission and Access Control

### **Granular Permission Framework**
- **Global Management Permissions**: Control over global policy creation and assignment
- **Domain Management Profiles**: Customizable permission sets for domain-level administrators
- **Policy Layer Permissions**: Specific access control for different policy components
- **Cross-Domain Visibility**: Controlled access to global objects within local domains
