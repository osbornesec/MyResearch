# Check Point Gaia Bond Interface Link Aggregation

## Core Concept
Bond interfaces in Check Point Gaia OS implement link aggregation (802.3ad LACP) that combines multiple physical interfaces into a single logical interface, providing increased bandwidth, load distribution, and high availability through redundancy.

## Technical Implementation
Bond interface configuration supports:
- **Active-Backup Mode**: One active link with failover capability
- **802.3ad LACP**: Dynamic link aggregation with load balancing
- **Load Balancing Algorithms**: Round-robin, XOR, broadcast modes
- **Failover Detection**: Link monitoring and automatic failover

Configuration verification through Gaia Portal and Clish monitoring tools ensures proper bond operation.

## High Availability Integration
Bond interfaces integrate with VRRP clustering to provide:
- Interface-level redundancy within cluster members
- Enhanced cluster reliability through multiple uplink paths
- Coordinated failover between bond members and cluster nodes
