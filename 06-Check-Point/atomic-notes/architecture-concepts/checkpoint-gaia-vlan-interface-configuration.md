# Check Point Gaia VLAN Interface Configuration

## Core Concept
Check Point Gaia OS supports VLAN (Virtual LAN) interfaces that enable logical network segmentation on physical interfaces, allowing multiple isolated network segments to share the same physical infrastructure through 802.1Q tagging.

## Technical Implementation
VLAN interfaces in Gaia can be configured in two modes:
- **Access Mode VLAN**: Single VLAN assignment per interface
- **Trunk Mode VLAN**: Multiple VLANs tagged on single interface

Configuration methods:
1. **Gaia Portal**: Web-based GUI configuration
2. **Gaia Clish**: Command-line interface configuration

## Network Architecture Impact
- Enables network segmentation without additional physical infrastructure
- Supports complex routing topologies with logical separation
- Integrates with Check Point security policies for VLAN-aware security

## Connection Potential
- Links to [[checkpoint-gaia-physical-interface-management]]
- Connects to [[checkpoint-vlan-security-policy-integration]]
- Relates to [[checkpoint-network-interface-bonding]]

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 Gaia Administration Guide
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor documentation
