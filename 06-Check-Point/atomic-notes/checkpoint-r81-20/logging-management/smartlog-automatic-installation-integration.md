# SmartLog Automatic Installation Integration

*SmartLog is automatically installed as part of the SmartConsole suite with zero additional configuration required*

## Core Concept

SmartLog is automatically installed as part of the SmartConsole suite with no additional configuration required, exemplifying Check Point's zero-configuration deployment philosophy for core security management components.

## Zero-Configuration Architecture

This approach eliminates installation complexity and reduces deployment time by bundling essential logging capabilities with the primary management interface, ensuring immediate functionality upon SmartConsole installation.

## Implementation Characteristics

- **Installation Method**: Automatic with SmartConsole suite
- **Configuration Requirements**: None (zero-configuration)
- **Deployment Time**: Immediate availability
- **Dependencies**: SmartConsole installation only

## Connection Networks
