# URL Filtering RAD Service Architecture

Resource Advisor service providing real-time URL categorization through cloud-based lookup with intelligent local caching optimization for high-performance web security.

## Service Components

- **Local Database**: Pattern-based initial URL matching
- **RAD Cache**: High-hit-rate local categorization cache (99%)
- **Cloud Service**: Real-time threat intelligence categorization
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking URL classification

## Performance Strategy

- **Three-Tier Lookup**: Local → Cache → Cloud progression
- **Cache Optimization**: Intelligent cache population and refresh
- **Response Speed**: Maximized through strategic caching
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Minimized cloud queries through caching

## Categorization Flow

- **Kernel Cache Query**: Initial URL reputation check
- **Host-Member Lookup**: Hierarchical URL analysis
- **Async Request Processing**: Non-blocking cloud categorization
- **Cache Population**: Automatic cache updates from cloud responses

## Enterprise Benefits

Maximizes URL filtering response speed through intelligent caching while maintaining current threat intelligence through selective cloud connectivity.

## Integration Points

- **Web Security Gateways**: Real-time URL filtering
- **Threat Intelligence Platforms**: External feed integration
- **Network Monitoring Systems**: Traffic analysis and reporting
- **Policy Enforcement**: URL-based access control

## Implementation Considerations

- **Cache Management**: Optimal cache size and refresh policies
- **Network Connectivity**: Cloud service availability requirements
- **Performance Tuning**: Cache hit rate optimization
- **Scalability**: Enterprise traffic volume handling
