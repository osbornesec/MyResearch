# IPS Intrusion Prevention System

## Core Concept
Check Point IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) is a software blade deployed on Security Gateways that inspects and analyzes packets and data streams to identify and prevent numerous types of network-based security risks and intrusion attempts.

## Technical Capabilities
- Performs deep packet inspection of network traffic
- Analyzes data streams for intrusion patterns and anomalies
- Provides real-time protection against network-based attacks
- Integrates with gateway security policy enforcement

## Threat Detection Scope
- Network intrusion attempts and exploitation
- Protocol-based attacks and vulnerabilities
- Malicious traffic patterns and behaviors
- Known attack signatures and zero-day threats

## Deployment Architecture
- Installed as software blade on Check Point Security Gateways
- Operates inline with network traffic flow
- Provides automated response and blocking capabilities
- Supports policy-based protection configuration

## Research Context
IPS represents a core component of Check Point's threat prevention suite, providing network-level protection to complement file-based and application-layer security measures.
