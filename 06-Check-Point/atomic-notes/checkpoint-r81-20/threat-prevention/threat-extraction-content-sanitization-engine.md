# Threat Extraction Content Sanitization Engine

## Core Concept
Threat Extraction removes potentially malicious content from files before they enter the corporate network by either extracting exploitable elements or creating safe PDF copies of documents.

## Sanitization Methods
- Extracts exploitable content from original files
- Converts suspicious documents to safe PDF format
- Delivers reconstructed files to users immediately
- Blocks access to original suspicious file versions

## Content Removal Capabilities
- Removes database queries containing clear-text passwords
- Eliminates embedded objects and active content
- Strips macros and JavaScript code
- Removes hyperlinks to sensitive information
- Cleans custom properties with sensitive data

## Operational Architecture
- Processes files from email attachments and web downloads
- Supports Threat Prevention API file submissions
- Runs in parallel with Threat Emulation analysis
- Provides immediate user access to sanitized content

## Research Context
Threat Extraction enables immediate productivity while maintaining security by delivering clean file versions while background analysis continues.
