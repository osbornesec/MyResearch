# Threat Emulation Resource Allocation Optimization

## Core Concept
Threat Emulation appliance resource allocation settings enable configuration of system resources for malware emulation, including hard disk space management and RAM allocation for virtual machines to optimize performance.

## RAM Allocation Configuration
- Default allocation: 70% of total appliance RAM
- Configurable range: 20-90% of total memory or 512MB-1000GB absolute values
- Dedicated-use appliances: increase available RAM allocation
- Multi-blade appliances: decrease RAM allocation for resource sharing

## Storage Management Integration
- Minimum hard disk space thresholds for emulation continuity
- Automatic log file deletion coordination with storage mechanisms
- Fail Mode settings determine traffic handling when resources unavailable
- Storage optimization tied to log retention policies

## Performance Impact Controls
- Memory limit exceeded actions: None, Log, Alert configurations
- Traffic acceptance tracking when emulation resources exhausted
- Network performance optimization through resource management
- Emulation performance tuning for appliance capabilities

## Research Context
Resource optimization ensures effective threat emulation performance while maintaining network throughput and system stability in enterprise deployments.
