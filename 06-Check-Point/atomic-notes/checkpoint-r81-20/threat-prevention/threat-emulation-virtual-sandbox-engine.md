# SandBlast Threat Emulation Zero-Day Protection

## Core Concept
Threat Emulation provides zero-day protection by quarantining suspicious files in virtual sandbox environments that imitate standard operating systems to discover malicious behavior before threats enter the network.

## Sandbox Analysis Process
- Opens files on multiple virtual computers with different OS environments
- Monitors for unusual and malicious behavior patterns
- Detects unauthorized processes and registry key modifications
- Logs all malicious activities for threat analysis

## Detection Capabilities
- Catches malware at the exploit phase before network entry
- Identifies unknown threats that bypass signature-based detection
- Creates cryptographic hash signatures for new malware discoveries
- Prevents application of hacker evasion techniques

## Threat Intelligence Integration
- Saves new malicious file hashes to threat database
- Creates signatures for previously unknown malware
- Shares attack information with ThreatCloud repository
- Enables protection against future similar threats

## Research Context
Threat Emulation represents Check Point's advanced sandbox technology for detecting zero-day threats and unknown malware through behavioral analysis in controlled virtual environments.
