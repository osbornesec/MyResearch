# Threat Extraction Exploitable Content Types

## Core Concept
Threat Extraction identifies and removes specific categories of exploitable content from Microsoft Office and PDF documents that could be used for malware propagation or data exfiltration.

## Microsoft Office Exploitable Elements
- Database queries containing clear-text passwords
- Embedded objects with executable content
- Macros and JavaScript code for virus propagation
- Hyperlinks to sensitive information sources
- Custom document properties with sensitive data

## Document Metadata Risks
- Automatic saves containing deleted data archives
- Document statistics revealing owner information
- Creation and modification date metadata
- Summary properties with sensitive details

## Security Risk Categories
- Active content capable of code execution
- Information disclosure through metadata
- Credential exposure in embedded queries
- Malicious links to external resources

## Research Context
Understanding these specific content types enables effective document sanitization while preserving legitimate document functionality.
