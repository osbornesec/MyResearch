# Anti-Bot Malware Detection System

## Core Concept
The Check Point Anti-Bot software blade detects and prevents bot and botnet threats by identifying compromised computers that have been infected with malicious software designed to enable remote criminal control.

## Bot Infection Characteristics
- Takes control of infected computers
- Neutralizes existing Anti-Virus defenses
- Hides from detection by changing appearance
- Establishes command and control communication channels

## Criminal Activities Enabled
- Theft of personal, financial, and intellectual property data
- Spam distribution and email abuse
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Network bandwidth consumption and productivity reduction

## Advanced Threat Integration
- Frequently used as components of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
- Creates multiple simultaneous threat vectors
- Enables sustained criminal access to organizational resources

## Research Context
Anti-Bot protection addresses post-infection scenarios where traditional Anti-Virus solutions have been compromised or bypassed by sophisticated malware.
