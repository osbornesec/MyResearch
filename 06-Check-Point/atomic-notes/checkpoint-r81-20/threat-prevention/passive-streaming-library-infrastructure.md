# Passive Streaming Library Infrastructure

TCP stream reassembly technology that provides coherent data presentation to security applications while handling packet reordering, congestion control, and various TCP-layer security threats.

## Core Functions

- **TCP Stream Reassembly**: Reconstructs fragmented TCP connections
- **Packet Reordering**: Handles out-of-order packet delivery
- **Payload Overlap Handling**: Manages retransmission conflicts
- **DoS Attack Mitigation**: Protects against TCP-layer attacks

## Technical Architecture

- **Unified Streaming APIs**: Standardized interface for security applications
- **Network Problem Isolation**: Shields applications from transport issues
- **SecureXL Integration**: Receives packets from acceleration modules
- **Firewall Chain Integration**: Operates within security processing pipeline

## Security Benefits

- **Evasion Prevention**: Eliminates TCP-level attack vectors
- **Consistent Analysis**: Ensures reliable threat detection
- **Attack Surface Reduction**: Handles protocol vulnerabilities
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient stream processing

## Enterprise Value

Eliminates network-level evasion techniques that exploit TCP implementation inconsistencies, ensuring reliable threat detection across all security blades.

## Integration Points

- **IPS Context Management**: Provides clean data streams for analysis
- **Multi-Blade Coordination**: Supports multiple security functions
- **Protocol Parser Framework**: Feeds sanitized data to parsers
- **Network Security Monitoring**: Integrates with SIEM platforms

## Implementation Considerations

- **Memory Management**: Efficient buffer allocation for high throughput
- **Latency Impact**: Minimal delay for stream reassembly
- **Scalability**: Handles enterprise-level connection volumes
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of corrupted streams
