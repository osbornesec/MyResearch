# Cross-Blade Policy Coordination Framework

Unified policy framework that coordinates security decisions across multiple security blades through shared context and transaction management for comprehensive threat prevention.

## Coordination Mechanisms

- **Shared Connection State**: Unified connection context across blades
- **Cross-Blade Data Aggregation**: Multi-source threat intelligence
- **Unified Transaction Processing**: Consistent security decision making
- **Coordinated Policy Enforcement**: Synchronized security actions

## Transaction Management

- **HTTP Transaction Context**: Request-response security analysis
- **Connection Transaction Context**: End-to-end session security
- **Data Aggregation Point**: Multi-blade threat correlation
- **Decision Coordination**: Unified security verdict processing

## Enterprise Integration Benefits

Provides holistic security decision-making that considers multiple threat vectors simultaneously, improving security effectiveness and reducing blind spots.

## Security Blade Coordination

- **Firewall**: Network access control coordination
- **IPS**: Intrusion prevention integration
- **Application Control**: Application-aware security
- **Content Awareness**: Data loss prevention coordination
- **Identity Awareness**: User-context security enforcement

## Integration Points

- **Unified Policy Framework**: Centralized policy management
- **Security Orchestration**: Automated response coordination
- **Threat Intelligence**: Multi-source correlation
- **Compliance Frameworks**: Regulatory requirement coordination

## Implementation Considerations

- **Performance Optimization**: Minimal coordination overhead
- **Policy Consistency**: Unified rule processing across blades
- **Scalability**: Enterprise-level transaction volumes
- **Failure Handling**: Graceful degradation during blade failures
