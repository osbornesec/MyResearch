# Threat Prevention Policy Independent Architecture

## Core Concept
Check Point Threat Prevention policies operate as dedicated policy layers separate from Access Control policies, enabling independent installation and management of IPS, Anti-Bot, Anti-Virus, Threat Emulation, and Threat Extraction protections.

## Policy Separation Benefits
- Independent installation minimizes performance impact on Security Gateways
- Selective deployment of threat prevention policies without access control changes
- Granular control over threat protection updates and configurations
- Reduced gateway processing overhead during policy installations

## Installation Architecture
- Global toolbar-based policy installation interface
- Support for independent gateway installation modes
- Cluster-aware installation with member synchronization
- Version-specific installation failure management

## Predefined Rule Framework
- Automatic predefined rule creation upon blade enablement
- All-traffic inspection scope with optimized profile defaults
- Universal network object protection coverage
- Comprehensive logging and gateway installation

## Research Context
This architectural separation enables enterprise deployment patterns where threat protection updates can be managed independently from network access control changes.
