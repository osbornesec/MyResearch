# Check Point Geo Protection Update Verification

## Core Concept
Geo Protection updates in Check Point Security Gateways can be verified by examining the timestamp of the IpToCountry.csv file, which is updated almost daily and indicates the last successful geolocation database refresh.

## Verification Method

### File Location and Command
**Path**: `$FWDIR/tmp/geo_location_tmp/updates/IpToCountry.csv`

**Verification command**:
```bash
ls -l $FWDIR/tmp/geo_location_tmp/updates/IpToCountry.csv
```

### Update Characteristics
- **Update frequency**: Almost daily automatic updates
- **File creation**: Every Geo Protection update creates/refreshes this file
- **Timestamp significance**: File modification time indicates last successful update
- **Internet dependency**: Requires Security Gateway internet connectivity

## Troubleshooting Approach

### Normal Operation Indicators
- File timestamp shows recent date (within 24-48 hours)
- File exists at specified location
- Regular timestamp progression over time

### Issue Investigation
- **Missing file**: Geo Protection updates not functioning
- **Stale timestamp**: Update mechanism failure or connectivity issues
- **False negatives with current file**: Requires Check Point Support assistance

## Environmental Requirements
- **Internet connectivity**: Security Gateway must have outbound access
- **Update mechanism**: Automatic download and database refresh process
- **File system access**: Proper permissions for update file creation

## Application Context
- **Security Gateways**: All internet-connected Check Point appliances
- **Version compatibility**: R80.10+ through current releases
- **Operating system**: Gaia OS environments
