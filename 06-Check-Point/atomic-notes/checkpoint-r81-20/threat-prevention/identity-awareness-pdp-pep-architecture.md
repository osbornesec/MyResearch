# Identity Awareness PDP-PEP Architecture

Policy Decision Point and Policy Enforcement Point architecture enabling identity-based security enforcement through distributed authentication, authorization, and policy coordination.

## Architecture Components

- **Policy Decision Point (PDP)**: Central authorization processing
- **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)**: Distributed traffic enforcement
- **Identity Sources**: Multi-method user identification
- **Cross-Gateway Sharing**: Distributed identity propagation

## Identity Flow Architecture

- **Identity Source Integration**: AD Query, Browser Auth, Identity Agents
- **PDP Authorization**: User directory integration and role matching
- **PEP Enforcement**: Traffic-level identity-based access control
- **Shared Intelligence**: Cross-gateway identity synchronization

## Security Transformation

- **Anonymous to Identity-Aware**: IP-based to user-based security
- **Comprehensive Context**: User and machine identity integration
- **Scalable Architecture**: Enterprise-wide identity enforcement
- **Flexible Deployment**: PDP/PEP separation or co-location

## Enterprise Value

Transforms anonymous IP-based security into comprehensive identity-aware access control with full user and machine context for enhanced security posture.

## Integration Points

- **Active Directory**: Native enterprise directory integration
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Identity-centric security model
- **Access Governance**: Policy and compliance coordination
- **SIEM Integration**: Identity-enriched security analytics

## Implementation Considerations

- **Directory Integration**: Multi-domain AD support
- **Performance Scaling**: High-volume identity processing
- **High Availability**: Redundant PDP deployment
- **Identity Lifecycle**: User provisioning and deprovisioning
