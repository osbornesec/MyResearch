# HTTPS Traffic Categorization Passive Analysis

Privacy-preserving HTTPS analysis technique that categorizes encrypted traffic through certificate Common Name extraction and caching without requiring SSL/TLS decryption.

## Technical Implementation

- **SSL Handshake Analysis**: Certificate extraction during negotiation
- **CN-Based Categorization**: Common Name reputation lookup
- **IP+Port Caching**: Connection-to-certificate mapping
- **Certificate Validation**: CN authenticity verification

## Privacy-Preserving Benefits

- **Encryption Integrity**: No SSL/TLS decryption required
- **User Privacy**: Content remains encrypted
- **Compliance Friendly**: Meets privacy regulations
- **Performance Efficient**: Minimal processing overhead

## Categorization Process

- **Client Hello Recognition**: SSL request pattern matching
- **Certificate Extraction**: Server certificate CN analysis
- **RAD Integration**: Real-time categorization lookup
- **Cache Population**: Efficient CN-to-category mapping

## Enterprise Value

Enables comprehensive URL filtering and categorization while preserving encryption integrity and maintaining user privacy compliance.

## Integration Points

- **URL Filtering Engine**: HTTPS traffic analysis
