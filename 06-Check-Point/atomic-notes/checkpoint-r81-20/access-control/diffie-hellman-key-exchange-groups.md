# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Group Mathematics

## Core Concept
Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol enables two parties to independently create a shared secret key without directly exchanging symmetric keys, using mathematical groups of varying bit strengths to establish secure communication foundations.

## Mathematical Foundation
- **Exponential Key Agreement**: Based on computational difficulty of discrete logarithm problem
- **Shared Secret Creation**: Both peers independently compute identical shared secret
- **No Key Transmission**: Symmetric keys never actually exchanged over network
- **Mathematical Security**: Security derived from mathematical complexity of DH problem

## Supported DH Groups
- **Group 1**: 768-bit strength (legacy compatibility)
- **Group 2**: 1024-bit strength (default for compatibility)
- **Group 5**: 1536-bit strength (enhanced security)
- **Group 14**: 2048-bit strength (recommended modern standard)
- **Group 19**: 256-bit Elliptic Curve Prime (ECP) (efficient high security)
- **Group 20**: 384-bit Elliptic Curve Prime (maximum ECP security)

## Security vs Performance Trade-off
- **Higher Bit Groups**: More secure against cryptographic attacks
- **Computational Cost**: More bits require significantly more CPU cycles
- **Performance Impact**: Key generation time increases with group size
- **Security Requirement**: Group selection based on security requirements vs performance needs

## IKE Phase Usage
- **Phase I Application**: DH groups used during initial IKE Security Association
- **Phase II Application**: Same DH groups available for IPsec Security Association
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Additional DH key generation in Phase II when PFS enabled
- **Group Consistency**: Both phases can use same or different DH groups

## Implementation Considerations
- **Peer Compatibility**: Both VPN peers must support selected DH group
- **Standards Compliance**: Groups based on RFC-defined mathematical parameters
- **Future-Proofing**: Higher groups provide protection against advancing cryptographic attacks
- **Legacy Support**: Lower groups maintained for compatibility with older systems

## Key Material Integration
- **IKE Key Derivation**: DH shared secret used to derive IKE encryption keys
- **IPsec Key Building**: Phase II uses Phase I DH key plus new key material
- **Cryptographic Strength**: Overall VPN security limited by weakest DH group used
- **Key Lifetime**: DH keys used for duration of IKE/IPsec Security Association lifetimes

## Administrative Configuration
- **SmartConsole Selection**: DH groups configured through VPN Community encryption settings
- **Policy Distribution**: DH group settings distributed to all community member gateways
- **Negotiation Process**: Peers negotiate mutually supported DH group during IKE
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Lower groups used if higher groups not mutually supported
