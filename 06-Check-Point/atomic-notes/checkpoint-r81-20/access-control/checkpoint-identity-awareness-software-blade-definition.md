# Check Point Identity Awareness Software Blade Definition

## Core Concept
Identity Awareness is a Check Point Software Blade on a Security Gateway that enforces network access and audits data based on network location, the identity of the user, and the identity of the computer.

## Key Capabilities
- Maps users and computer identities to IP addresses
- Extends traditional firewall beyond IP-based filtering
- Enforces Access Control policy rules based on identity
- Provides identity-based auditing and logging
- Supports both Active Directory and non-Active Directory networks
- Works for employees and guest users

## Technical Implementation
- Uses Source and Destination IP addresses to identify users and computers
- Enables identity elements as matching criteria in Access Control policy Source and Destination fields
- Integrates with multiple identity sources for comprehensive coverage

## Research Context
Essential foundation concept for enterprise identity-aware network security that transforms IP-based filtering into identity-centric access control.
