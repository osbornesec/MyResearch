# Post-Connect Script Automation Framework

## Core Concept
Post-Connect feature enables automatic execution of custom scripts on endpoint computers after Remote Access client establishes VPN connection, providing automation capabilities for network configuration, application launch, and system integration tasks.

## Script Execution Architecture
- **Post-Connection Trigger**: Scripts execute automatically after successful VPN tunnel establishment
- **Endpoint Execution**: Scripts run locally on user's endpoint computer
- **Administrative Control**: Scripts configured and managed through centralized VPN policy
- **Event-Driven Automation**: VPN connection event triggers predefined automation workflows

## Use Case Applications
- **Network Configuration**: Automatic configuration of network settings and routes
- **Application Launch**: Automatic startup of corporate applications requiring VPN connectivity
- **Drive Mapping**: Automatic mapping of network drives and shared resources
- **System Integration**: Integration with corporate systems and services

## Security Considerations
- **Administrative Privileges**: Script execution may require elevated privileges on endpoint
- **Code Validation**: Scripts should be validated and tested before deployment
- **Security Scanning**: Script content subject to security review and approval
- **User Permission**: User consent and awareness of script execution activities

## Implementation Framework
- **Script Language Support**: Support for various scripting languages and batch files
- **Parameter Passing**: Ability to pass VPN session parameters to scripts
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for script execution failures
- **Logging Integration**: Script execution results logged for monitoring and troubleshooting

## Administrative Management
- **Centralized Configuration**: Scripts configured through VPN policy management
- **User Group Policies**: Different scripts for different user groups and roles
- **Version Control**: Script versioning and update management
- **Deployment Control**: Controlled rollout of scripts to user populations

## Client Integration
- **Transparent Execution**: Scripts execute without complex user intervention
- **Status Feedback**: User notification of script execution status and results
- **Failure Recovery**: Graceful handling of script execution failures
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal impact on VPN connection establishment performance

## Enterprise Automation
- **Workflow Integration**: Integration with enterprise workflow and automation systems
- **Compliance Automation**: Automated compliance checks and configuration enforcement
- **Resource Provisioning**: Automatic provisioning of user-specific resources
- **Monitoring Integration**: Script execution monitoring and performance tracking
