# Secure Configuration Verification Endpoint Compliance

## Core Concept
Secure Configuration Verification (SCV) provides automated endpoint security assessment for Endpoint Security VPN and Check Point Mobile clients, validating client security posture before granting VPN access to prevent network compromise.

## Comprehensive Security Checks
- **OS Monitor**: Validates operating system version, service pack level, and screen saver configuration
- **HotFix Monitor**: Verifies installation status of critical security patches and updates
- **Group Monitor**: Confirms user domain group membership and authentication status
- **Process Monitor**: Validates running security software (anti-virus) and blocks dangerous applications

## Default SCV Plugin Architecture
- **Integrated Plugins**: Default SCV checks included with Endpoint Security VPN installation
- **OPSEC Extensions**: Third-party security product integration through OPSEC API
- **Custom Checks**: Ability to define organization-specific security validation requirements
- **Extensible Framework**: Support for additional security vendor integrations

## Policy-Based Validation
- **SCV Policy Configuration**: Centralized policy definition for security requirement validation
- **User Group Policies**: Different security requirements based on user role and group membership
- **Graduated Requirements**: Varying security levels based on access sensitivity
- **Compliance Enforcement**: Automatic access denial for non-compliant endpoints

## Real-Time Assessment
- **Pre-Connection Validation**: Security checks performed before VPN tunnel establishment
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing security posture validation during VPN sessions
- **Dynamic Response**: Real-time access restriction based on security state changes
- **Remediation Guidance**: User notifications and instructions for achieving compliance

## Enterprise Security Integration
- **Network Threat Prevention**: Prevents compromised endpoints from accessing internal networks
- **Administrative Control**: IT control over endpoint security requirements without administrative access
- **Compliance Reporting**: Comprehensive reporting of endpoint security status and violations
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces security risk from unmanaged and potentially compromised endpoints

## Technical Implementation
- **Client-Side Execution**: SCV checks run locally on endpoint devices
- **Secure Communication**: Check results transmitted securely to Security Gateway
- **Policy Distribution**: SCV policies distributed from Security Management Server
- **Result Processing**: Gateway makes access decisions based on SCV validation results

## User Experience Considerations
- **Administrative Privileges**: Effectiveness enhanced when users lack administrative rights
- **Transparent Operation**: Security checks performed with minimal user interaction
- **Failure Handling**: Clear guidance provided when security requirements not met
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal impact on endpoint performance during validation
