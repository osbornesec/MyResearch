# Traditional Firewall IP Address Limitation

## Core Concept
Traditional firewalls use IP addresses to monitor traffic and are unaware of the user and computer identities behind IP addresses, creating a fundamental security visibility gap.

## Limitation Details
- Firewalls can only see and filter based on IP addresses
- No visibility into which users are generating traffic
- No awareness of which computers are involved in connections
- Cannot enforce policies based on user roles or computer types
- Limited audit capabilities for identity-based compliance

## Security Implications
- Reduced granular access control capabilities
- Inability to implement role-based network access
- Limited forensic capabilities for security incidents
- Compliance challenges for identity-based regulations
- No support for user-aware security policies

## Solution Approach
Identity Awareness bridges this gap by mapping users and computer identities to IP addresses, enabling identity-centric security policies.

## Research Context
Foundational security limitation that Identity Awareness specifically addresses in enterprise network security architecture.
