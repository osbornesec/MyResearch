# SmartEvent Centralized Real-Time Event Correlation

*SmartEvent provides centralized, real-time event correlation of log data from Check Point perimeter, internal, and Web security gateways, as well as third-party security devices*

## Core Concept

SmartEvent provides centralized, real-time event correlation of log data from Check Point perimeter, internal, and Web security gateways, as well as third-party security devices, enabling comprehensive security event analysis across heterogeneous security infrastructures.

## Centralized Correlation Architecture

The system aggregates and correlates security events from multiple sources in real-time, providing unified threat visibility and coordinated response capabilities across the entire security infrastructure.
