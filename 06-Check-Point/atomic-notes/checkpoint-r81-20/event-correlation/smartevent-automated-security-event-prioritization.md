# SmartEvent Automated Security Event Prioritization

*SmartEvent automatically prioritizes security events for decisive, intelligent action by aggregating and correlating raw log data*

## Core Concept

SmartEvent automatically prioritizes security events for decisive, intelligent action by aggregating and correlating raw log data, enabling security teams to focus on the most critical threats through intelligent automation.

## Automated Prioritization Framework

The system employs sophisticated algorithms to analyze and rank security events based on severity, impact, and contextual factors, reducing alert fatigue and improving response effectiveness.

**Aggregation Process**:
- **Raw Log Collection**: Systematic gathering of security event data
- **Data Correlation**: Pattern analysis across multiple event sources
- **Context Analysis**: Environmental and threat landscape considerations
- **Risk Assessment**: Automated evaluation of potential impact

**Intelligence Integration**:
- **Threat Intelligence**: External threat data integration
- **Environmental Context**: Network topology and asset importance
- **Historical Analysis**: Pattern recognition from previous incidents
- **Real-Time Factors**: Current threat landscape considerations
