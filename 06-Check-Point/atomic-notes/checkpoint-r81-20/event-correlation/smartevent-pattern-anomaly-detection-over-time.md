# SmartEvent Pattern Anomaly Detection Over Time

*SmartEvent detects threats through pattern anomalies that may not be detected when viewed in isolation per device but appear when data is correlated over time*

## Core Concept

SmartEvent detects threats through pattern anomalies that may not be detected when viewed in isolation per device but appear when data is correlated over time, enabling discovery of sophisticated attacks that evade single-point detection systems.

## Temporal Correlation Framework

The system analyzes security events across time dimensions to identify patterns that indicate coordinated attacks, persistent threats, or gradual compromise attempts that single-event analysis would miss.

## Pattern Analysis Methodology

**Temporal Pattern Recognition**:
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Identification of patterns across extended timeframes
- **Correlation Windows**: Configurable time periods for pattern analysis

- **Trend Analysis**: Long-term security posture evaluation

**Cross-Device Correlation**:
- **Multi-Point Analysis**: Events from different devices correlated temporally
- **Infrastructure-Wide Visibility**: Comprehensive attack surface monitoring
- **Distributed Threat Detection**: Coordinated attack identification
