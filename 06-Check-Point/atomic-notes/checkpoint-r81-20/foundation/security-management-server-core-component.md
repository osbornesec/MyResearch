# Security Management Server Core Component

## Core Management Concept
The Security Management Server functions as the central control point that manages Security Gateways with defined security policies and monitors security events across the network infrastructure.

## Administrative Context
As the heart of Check Point's security architecture, the Security Management Server maintains the authoritative security policy database, coordinates policy deployment to distributed Security Gateways, and aggregates security events for centralized monitoring and analysis.

## Implementation Details
- Serves as the centralized policy definition and storage repository
- Manages multiple Security Gateways from a single control point
- Provides security event collection and monitoring capabilities
- Supports both basic deployment and multi-domain configurations

## Integration Requirements
- Accessed and configured through SmartConsole interface
- Communicates with Security Gateways for policy distribution
- Integrates with logging and monitoring systems for event correlation
- Foundation for all security policy management and enforcement workflows
