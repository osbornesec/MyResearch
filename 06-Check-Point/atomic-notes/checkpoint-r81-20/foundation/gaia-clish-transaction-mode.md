# Gaia Clish Transaction Mode

## Core Concept
Gaia Clish provides transaction mode functionality where administrators can start a transaction (start command), make multiple configuration changes, then either commit all changes at once (commit command) or discard all changes (rollback command), ensuring atomic configuration operations.

## Research Context
Advanced configuration safety mechanism for ensuring consistent configuration changes, essential for complex multi-step configuration procedures.
