# Gaia Configuration Lock Mechanism

## Core Concept
Gaia implements an exclusive configuration lock system where only one user can have Read/Write access to configuration settings at a time, while all other users have Read-Only access. Users can override existing locks, and locks persist even when browsers are closed until explicitly released or timeout (default 10 minutes).

## Research Context
Critical concurrency control mechanism for preventing configuration conflicts in multi-administrator environments, essential for understanding safe configuration management practices.
