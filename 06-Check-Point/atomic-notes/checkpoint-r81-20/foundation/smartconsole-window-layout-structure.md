# SmartConsole Window Layout Structure

## Core Management Concept
SmartConsole organizes management functions through a structured window layout containing six primary components: Global Toolbar, Session Management Toolbar, Navigation Toolbar, Objects Bar, Validations pane, and Command Line Interface access.

## Administrative Context
The standardized window layout provides administrators with consistent access to all security management functions, ensuring efficient navigation between different administrative tasks and maintaining operational context during complex configuration workflows.

## Implementation Details
- Global Toolbar (1): Primary action controls at the top of interface
- Session Management Toolbar (2): Session control and status management
- Navigation Toolbar (3): Left-side view switching between major functional areas
- Objects Bar (4): Right-side access to security and network object management (F11)
- Validations pane (5): Right-side display of configuration validation errors
- Command Line Interface button (6): Bottom access to CLI functionality

## Integration Requirements
- Supports keyboard shortcuts for rapid navigation between functional areas
- Integrates with all major management workflows including policy, gateway, and monitoring
- Provides consistent interface paradigm across all Check Point management tasks
- Foundation for administrator efficiency and standardized operational procedures
