# Gaia Syslog Severity Levels

## Core Concept
Gaia implements RFC 5424 compliant syslog severity levels including emerg (system unusable), alert (immediate action required), crit (critical conditions), err (error conditions), warning (warning conditions), notice (normal but significant), info (informational), debug (debug-level), and all (all messages) with least severe severity taking precedence when multiple levels are configured.

## Research Context
Log filtering and prioritization framework for managing system event visibility and alert noise, essential for effective system monitoring and incident response.
