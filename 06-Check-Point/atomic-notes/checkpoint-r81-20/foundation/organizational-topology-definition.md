# Organizational Topology Definition

## Core Management Concept
Organizational topology definition involves mapping all network components (physical and logical) including Security Gateways, hosts, devices, servers, services, networks, and address ranges into corresponding SmartConsole objects that form the foundation of security policy configuration.

## Administrative Context
This essential planning activity creates the comprehensive asset inventory and user database that serves as the reference framework for all subsequent security policy decisions, ensuring complete coverage of organizational resources requiring protection.

## Implementation Details
- Map physical and virtual Security Gateways to object representations
- Define host objects for servers, workstations, and critical systems
- Configure hand-held device objects for mobile security management
- Create service objects for applications and network services
- Establish network and address range objects for logical segmentation
- Build user and group databases through manual entry, LDAP, or Active Directory integration
- Organize objects into logical groups for efficient policy management

## Integration Requirements
- Integrates with SmartConsole object management for configuration storage
- Connects to LDAP and User Directory systems for automated user population
- Supports Active Directory integration for enterprise user management
- Foundation for all network object types and security policy rule configuration
