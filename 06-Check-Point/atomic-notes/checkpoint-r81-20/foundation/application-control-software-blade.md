# Application Control Software Blade

## Core Concept
The Application Control Software Blade provides granular application identification, allowing, and blocking capabilities for thousands of applications, protecting against increasing threat vectors and malware introduced by internet applications.

## Security Architecture Context
Delivers application-layer security control by leveraging deep packet inspection to identify and control specific applications, providing protection beyond traditional port and protocol-based filtering.

## Key Capabilities
- **Granular Application Control**: Identifies, allows, or blocks thousands of individual applications
- **Threat Vector Protection**: Guards against malware and threats introduced through internet applications
- **Deep Packet Inspection**: Uses advanced analysis to identify applications regardless of port or protocol
- **Comprehensive Application Library**: Leverages industry's largest application database
- **AppWiki Integration**: Access to extensive application intelligence and categorization

## Application Library Scale
- **4,500+ Applications**: Comprehensive detection of major applications
- **100,000+ Web 2.0 Widgets**: Extensive coverage of web-based applications and components
- **Frequent Updates**: Worldwide application and widget database continuously updated

## Detection Methodology
Uses deep packet inspection techniques to identify applications based on behavior and content patterns rather than relying solely on port and protocol information.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 Security Gateway Administration Guide (2022)
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor documentation
