# Gaia System Logging Configuration

## Core Concept
Gaia system logging supports sending syslog messages to Check Point Management Servers, configuration audit logs for authorized user changes, and remote syslog server forwarding with configurable severity levels (emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info, debug, all) and custom log file destinations.

## Research Context
System monitoring and audit trail capability for tracking configuration changes and system events, essential for security compliance and troubleshooting.
