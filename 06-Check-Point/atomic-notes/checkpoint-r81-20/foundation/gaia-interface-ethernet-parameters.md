# Gaia Interface Ethernet Parameters

## Core Concept
Gaia interface Ethernet configuration includes auto-negotiation or manual link speed/duplex settings (10M/100M/1000M with half/full duplex), Hardware MAC address configuration, MTU settings (68-16000 bytes, default 1500), and Monitor Mode capability for passive network monitoring.

## Research Context
Physical layer network configuration for optimizing performance and enabling specialized monitoring capabilities in Gaia deployments.
