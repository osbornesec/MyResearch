# Security Management Planning Methodology

## Core Management Concept
Security management planning follows a structured three-phase methodology: define organizational topology, establish access rules for resource protection, and enforce access policies through properly configured Security Gateways with appropriate Software Blade activation.

## Administrative Context
This fundamental planning framework ensures systematic security implementation by first mapping organizational assets and users, then defining protective access controls, and finally deploying enforcement mechanisms that maintain security posture across the protected environment.

## Implementation Details
- Phase 1: Define organizational network topology including physical and virtual components
- Phase 2: Configure access rules and group them into policies for resource protection
- Phase 3: Configure Security Gateways with appropriate Software Blades and install policies
- Includes user and group definition through manual entry, LDAP, or Active Directory integration
- Supports preventative actions against threats through Anti-Virus and Anti-Malware
- Enables user education through UserCheck integration

## Integration Requirements
- Requires Security Management Server and Security Gateway installation completion
- Integrates with user directory systems for identity management
- Connects to policy management systems for rule enforcement
- Foundation for comprehensive security architecture deployment and operational management
