# CoreXL Performance Technology

## Core Concept
CoreXL is a performance-enhancing technology for Security Gateways on multi-core platforms that replicates the Firewall kernel multiple times, with each CoreXL Firewall instance running on one CPU core to handle traffic concurrently.

## Security Architecture Context
Enables linear scalability of security processing performance by leveraging multiple CPU cores without requiring changes to management infrastructure or network topology.

## Key Capabilities
- **Multi-Core Utilization**: Creates independent Firewall instances for each CPU core
- **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple instances handle traffic simultaneously
- **Linear Scalability**: Performance increases proportionally with number of CPU cores
- **Complete Inspection**: Each instance provides full, independent Firewall inspection capabilities
- **Unified Policy**: All instances apply the same security policy consistently
- **Transparent Operation**: No changes required to management or network infrastructure

## CoreXL Firewall Instance Architecture
Each replicated Firewall kernel instance operates as a complete and independent security inspection engine, processing traffic through the same interfaces while applying identical security policies.

## Integration with SecureXL
CoreXL Firewall instances work in conjunction with SecureXL instances to provide comprehensive performance optimization across the entire traffic processing pipeline.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 Security Gateway Administration Guide (2022)
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor documentation
