# Gateways and Servers Configuration View

## Core Management Concept
The Gateways & Servers configuration view (Ctrl+1) provides comprehensive management capabilities for Security Gateways including gateway lifecycle management, Software Blade activation, clustering, scripting, backup/restore operations, and status monitoring.

## Administrative Context
This primary administrative view centralizes all gateway-related management tasks, enabling administrators to configure, monitor, and maintain the distributed security enforcement infrastructure from a unified interface.

## Implementation Details
- Manage Security Gateway configurations and settings
- Activate and configure Software Blades for enhanced security functions
- Add, edit, or delete Security Gateways and clusters (including virtual clusters)
- Execute management scripts for automated configuration tasks
- Perform backup and restore operations for gateway configurations
- Access command line interface directly on Security Gateways
- Monitor real-time Security Gateway operational status

## Integration Requirements
- Integrates with Security Management Server for policy deployment
- Connects to individual gateways for direct configuration access
- Supports cluster management for high availability deployments
- Foundation for all gateway lifecycle and operational management workflows
