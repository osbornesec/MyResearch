# Gateway Topology Management

## Core Management Concept
Gateway topology management requires manual updates to Security Gateway topology configuration as network infrastructure changes, ensuring accurate representation of gateway interfaces and network connectivity for proper policy enforcement and traffic handling.

## Administrative Context
This essential maintenance procedure maintains synchronization between actual network infrastructure and gateway configuration, ensuring policy effectiveness and preventing connectivity issues as organizational networks evolve and expand.

## Implementation Details
- Manual topology updates required when network infrastructure changes
- Access through SmartConsole Gateways & Servers for topology management
- Interface configuration updates reflect actual gateway network connectivity
- Topology synchronization ensures accurate policy application to network segments
- Network change accommodation through systematic configuration updates
- Interface validation confirms successful gateway connectivity configuration

## Integration Requirements
- Requires SmartConsole access for topology configuration management
- Integrates with gateway interface configuration for network connectivity
- Supports network infrastructure change accommodation and validation
- Foundation for accurate policy enforcement and network connectivity management workflows
