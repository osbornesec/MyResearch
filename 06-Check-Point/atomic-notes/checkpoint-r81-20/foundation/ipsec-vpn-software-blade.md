# IPsec VPN Software Blade

## Core Concept
The IPsec VPN Software Blade encrypts and decrypts traffic between Security Gateways, Cluster Members, Scalable Platform Security Groups and other Security Gateways and clients, providing secure communication tunnels across untrusted networks.

## Security Architecture Context
Enables secure network connectivity across public networks by establishing encrypted tunnels between Check Point security infrastructure components and external sites or remote clients.

## Key Capabilities
- **Traffic Encryption**: Secures data in transit using IPsec protocols
- **Traffic Decryption**: Processes incoming encrypted communications
- **Gateway-to-Gateway Communication**: Enables secure site-to-site connectivity
- **Client Connectivity**: Supports remote access scenarios
- **Multi-Deployment Support**: Functions across various Security Gateway deployment models

## Integration Requirements
Works closely with the Firewall Software Blade and requires coordination with the Policy Server Software Blade for remote access scenarios involving desktop security policies.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 Security Gateway Administration Guide (2022)
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor documentation
