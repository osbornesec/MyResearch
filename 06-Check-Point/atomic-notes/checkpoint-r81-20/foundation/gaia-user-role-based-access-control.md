# Gaia User Role-Based Access Control

## Core Concept
Gaia implements role-based access control where user login determines navigation tree visibility and available Clish commands based on assigned roles, with users seeing only features they have access to, disabled controls for read-only access, and restricted command sets (show commands only for read-only, full commands for read-write access).

## Research Context
Security access control framework for limiting administrative privileges based on user roles, essential for maintaining principle of least privilege and operational security.
