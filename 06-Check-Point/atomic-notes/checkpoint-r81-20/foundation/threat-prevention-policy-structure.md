# Threat Prevention Policy Structure

## Core Concept
Threat Prevention Policy determines how the system inspects network connections for bots and viruses, using rule bases that leverage malware databases and network objects to provide comprehensive threat detection and prevention.

## Security Architecture Context
Forms a specialized layer of the security policy framework focused specifically on advanced threat detection, working in conjunction with access control policies to provide multi-layered protection.

## Key Components
- **Rule Base Structure**: Primary component containing threat inspection rules
- **Malware Database Integration**: Uses threat intelligence databases for detection
- **Network Object Utilization**: Leverages network topology definitions
- **Identity Awareness Integration**: Supports user and role-based threat policies
- **Protected Scope Definition**: Specifies which network segments receive protection

## Rule Structure Elements
Threat Prevention rules include protected scope, source/destination objects, protection profiles, services, actions (Basic/Optimized/Strict/Custom), tracking options, and installation targets.

## Action Profiles
Supports multiple protection levels including Basic (standard protection), Optimized (performance-focused), Strict (maximum security), and custom profiles tailored to specific requirements.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 Security Gateway Administration Guide (2022)
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor documentation
