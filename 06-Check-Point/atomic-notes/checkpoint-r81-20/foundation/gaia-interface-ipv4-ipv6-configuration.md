# Gaia Interface IPv4 IPv6 Configuration

## Core Concept
Gaia interfaces support both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing with manual configuration or automatic DHCP assignment, IPv6 requiring system-wide enablement and reboot, with limitations including no IPv6 on Management Interface (R81.20) and no IPv6 support on Multi-Domain Servers.

## Research Context
IP addressing fundamentals for Gaia network configuration, essential for understanding dual-stack network setup and platform-specific IP addressing limitations.
