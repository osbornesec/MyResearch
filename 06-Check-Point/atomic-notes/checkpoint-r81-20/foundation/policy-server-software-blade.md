# Policy Server Software Blade

## Core Concept
The Policy Server Software Blade enforces Desktop Security Policy on Remote Access Clients, controlling how the Firewall Software Blade on client machines inspects and manages traffic.

## Security Architecture Context
Extends Security Gateway policy enforcement to remote client endpoints, ensuring consistent security posture regardless of client location when connected via VPN.

## Key Functions
- **Desktop Policy Enforcement**: Implements security rules on remote client machines
- **Client-Side Traffic Control**: Manages how remote firewalls inspect traffic
- **Policy Distribution**: Delivers security configurations to remote access clients
- **Coordination with IPsec VPN**: Works in conjunction with VPN connectivity
- **Remote Security Consistency**: Maintains uniform security standards across distributed clients

## Operational Requirements
Requires enablement alongside the IPsec VPN Software Blade and integration with Desktop Security policy configuration in the Policy Package.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 Security Gateway Administration Guide (2022)
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor documentation
