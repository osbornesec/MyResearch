# Gaia SNMP v3 USM User Security

## Core Concept
Gaia SNMP v3 implements User-Based Security Model (USM) with configurable security levels including authPriv (authentication and privacy with encryption) and authNoPriv (authentication only), supporting authentication protocols (SHA256/SHA512) and privacy protocols (DES/AES) with user permissions (read-only/read-write).

## Research Context
Network monitoring security framework for secure SNMP access control, essential for maintaining network visibility while preventing unauthorized management access.
