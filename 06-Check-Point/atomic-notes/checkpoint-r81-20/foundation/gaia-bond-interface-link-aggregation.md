# Gaia Bond Interface Link Aggregation

## Core Concept
Gaia Bond interfaces implement IEEE 802.3ad Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) by joining multiple physical interfaces into one virtual interface for fault tolerance and increased throughput, supporting up to 8 physical subordinate interfaces per bond, identified by Bond ID with IP address assignment while subordinate interfaces remain without IP addresses.

## Research Context
Network resilience and performance optimization technology for combining multiple physical links into logical interfaces, essential for high-availability network design and bandwidth aggregation.
