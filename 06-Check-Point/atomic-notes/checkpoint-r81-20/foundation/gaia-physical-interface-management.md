# Gaia Physical Interface Management

## Core Concept
Gaia automatically identifies physical interfaces (NICs) on the computer with no ability to add or delete physical interfaces through Portal or Clish, requiring system shutdown for hardware changes, with automatic recognition and naming of new interfaces upon system restart.

## Research Context
Hardware interface management fundamentals for understanding physical network connectivity and hardware change procedures in Gaia environments.
