# Zero Phishing Software Blade

## Core Concept
Zero Phishing prevents unknown zero-day and known phishing attacks on websites in real-time by utilizing industry-leading Machine Learning algorithms and patented inspection technologies, providing browser-agnostic and platform-agnostic protection through the Security Gateway.

## Security Architecture Context
Introduced in R81.20 as an advanced Threat Prevention protection, this blade addresses the sophisticated phishing threat landscape by providing network-level protection that doesn't depend on endpoint or email security solutions.

## Key Capabilities
- **Zero-Day Phishing Prevention**: Blocks previously unknown phishing attacks in real-time
- **Machine Learning Analysis**: Uses advanced algorithms for threat detection
- **Browser-Agnostic Protection**: Works regardless of browser type or platform
- **Cloud-Based Analysis**: Leverages Check Point Cloud for comprehensive scanning
- **Dual-Engine Architecture**: Combines URL-based and in-browser analysis
- **No Client Installation**: Provides protection without requiring endpoint software

## Dual Protection Engines
1. **Real-time URL-based prevention** - Analyzes URL features like brand similarity, non-ASCII characters, and registration timing
2. **In-browser Zero Phishing** - Uses patented JavaScript injection to scan HTML forms and components in real-time

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 Security Gateway Administration Guide (2022)
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor documentation
