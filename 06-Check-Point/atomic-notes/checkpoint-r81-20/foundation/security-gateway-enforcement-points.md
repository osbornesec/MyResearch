# Security Gateway Enforcement Points

## Core Management Concept
Security Gateways are positioned at network perimeter points to protect organizational environments through active enforcement of security policies defined and distributed by the Security Management Server.

## Administrative Context
Security Gateways serve as the distributed enforcement layer in Check Point's architecture, receiving policy configurations from the central management server and applying real-time security controls to network traffic at strategic network boundaries.

## Implementation Details
- Deployed at network perimeter locations for traffic inspection
- Receive and enforce security policies from centralized management
- Provide real-time threat prevention and access control
- Support various deployment models including standalone and clustered configurations

## Integration Requirements
- Managed and configured through Security Management Server
- Receive policy updates through secure communication channels
- Report security events back to central management for monitoring
- Foundation for all network-based security enforcement and threat prevention
