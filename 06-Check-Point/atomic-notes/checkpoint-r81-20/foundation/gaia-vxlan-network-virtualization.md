# Gaia VXLAN Network Virtualization

## Core Concept
Gaia VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) interfaces support network virtualization using VXLAN Network Identifiers (VNI) between 1 and 16,777,215, configured with local physical interfaces, remote peer IPv4 addresses, and destination UDP ports (default 4789), requiring identical VNI and UDP port settings across VXLAN peers.

## Research Context
Network virtualization technology for creating overlay networks across physical infrastructure, essential for modern data center networking and multi-tenant environments.
