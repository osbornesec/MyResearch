# Anti-Virus Software Blade

## Core Concept
The Anti-Virus Software Blade correlates information from multiple detection engines to detect and block malware at Security Gateways, Cluster Members, and Scalable Platform Security Groups, with continuous updates from ThreatCloud intelligence.

## Security Architecture Context
Provides fundamental malware protection within the Threat Prevention framework, serving as a primary defense against known and emerging virus threats at the network gateway level.

## Key Capabilities
- **Multi-Engine Detection**: Correlates information from multiple detection engines for comprehensive coverage
- **Gateway-Level Protection**: Blocks malware before it reaches internal network resources
- **ThreatCloud Integration**: Receives continuous updates from collaborative threat intelligence network
- **Real-Time Protection**: Provides immediate threat detection and blocking capabilities
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Functions across various Security Gateway deployment models

## Detection Approach
Uses correlation across multiple detection engines rather than relying on a single detection method, improving accuracy and reducing false positives while enhancing threat coverage.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 Security Gateway Administration Guide (2022)
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor documentation

## Connection Potential
