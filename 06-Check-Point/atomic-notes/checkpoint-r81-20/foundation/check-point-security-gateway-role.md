# Check Point Security Gateway Role

## Core Concept
The Security Gateway serves as the enforcement engine that implements the organization's security policy at the network entry point to the LAN, operating under management by the Security Management Server.

## Security Architecture Context
The Security Gateway functions as the primary enforcement point in the Check Point security architecture, sitting between external networks (Internet) and the internal network to inspect and control all traffic according to configured security policies.

## Key Characteristics
- **Policy Enforcement Engine**: Actively implements security rules and policies
- **Network Entry Point**: Positioned at LAN boundary for traffic control
- **Managed Component**: Receives configuration and updates from Security Management Server
- **Scalable Deployment**: Can operate as standalone gateway, cluster, or scalable platform security group

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 Security Gateway Administration Guide (2022)
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor documentation

## Connection Potential
