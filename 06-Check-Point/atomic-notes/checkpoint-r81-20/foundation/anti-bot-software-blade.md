# Anti-Bot Software Blade

## Core Concept
The Anti-Bot Software Blade discovers bot infections by correlating multiple detection methods, providing post-infection detection of compromised hosts and preventing bot damage by blocking Command and Control (C&C) communications.

## Security Architecture Context
Functions as a critical component of the Threat Prevention solution, specifically targeting botnet activities that represent ongoing threats to network infrastructure and data security.

## Key Capabilities
- **Post-Infection Detection**: Identifies bots already present on network hosts
- **Multiple Detection Correlation**: Combines various detection techniques for improved accuracy
- **C&C Communication Blocking**: Prevents bots from receiving commands or exfiltrating data
- **ThreatCloud Integration**: Continuously updated through collaborative threat intelligence network
- **Damage Prevention**: Mitigates ongoing bot activities before they can cause significant harm

## Detection Methodology
Employs correlation of multiple detection methods to identify bot behavior patterns, providing more reliable identification than single-vector detection approaches.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 Security Gateway Administration Guide (2022)
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor documentation
