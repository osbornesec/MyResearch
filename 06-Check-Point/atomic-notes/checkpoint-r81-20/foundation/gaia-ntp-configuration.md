# Gaia NTP Configuration

## Core Concept
Gaia supports Network Time Protocol (NTP) for automatic time synchronization with configurable primary and secondary NTP servers, NTP version selection, and runs as a background client program sending periodic time requests to synchronize clocks to millisecond accuracy, with best practice recommendation for multiple servers for redundancy.

## Research Context
Automated time synchronization mechanism for maintaining accurate system clocks across Check Point infrastructure, essential for distributed system coordination and security protocols.
