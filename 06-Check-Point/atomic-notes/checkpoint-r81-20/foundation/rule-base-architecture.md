# Rule Base Architecture

## Core Concept
A Rule Base is a set of traffic parameters and other conditions in a Security Policy that cause specified actions to be taken for communication sessions, forming the structural foundation for all policy enforcement in Check Point security architecture.

## Security Architecture Context
Serves as the fundamental organizational unit for security policy logic, providing the framework within which all security decisions are structured and evaluated.

## Key Characteristics
- **Structured Decision Framework**: Organizes security logic into systematic evaluation patterns
- **Parameter-Based Matching**: Uses traffic characteristics to determine applicable rules
- **Condition-Action Mapping**: Links specific conditions to corresponding security actions
- **Session-Based Application**: Applies rules to individual communication sessions
- **Policy Component**: Functions as building block within larger Security Policy structures

## Types of Rule Bases
Different policy types utilize specialized rule base structures including Access Control Rule Base, NAT Rule Base, Desktop Rule Base, Threat Prevention Rule Base, and HTTPS Inspection Rule Base.

## Evaluation Process
Rules within a rule base are evaluated systematically against communication session parameters to determine appropriate security actions.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 Security Gateway Administration Guide (2022)
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor documentation
