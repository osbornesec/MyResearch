# Gaia Bond Operation Modes

## Core Concept
Gaia Bond interfaces support multiple operation modes including Round Robin (sequential interface selection), Active-Backup (high availability with primary interface), XOR (load sharing based on Layer 2 or Layer 3+4 hash), 802.3ad (dynamic LACP with hash policies), and ABXOR (bundle-based active/standby with hash distribution), with platform-specific limitations for certain modes.

## Research Context
Link aggregation strategy options for optimizing network performance and availability based on deployment requirements, essential for choosing appropriate bonding configuration for specific use cases.
