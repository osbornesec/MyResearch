# Threat Emulation Software Blade

## Core Concept
The Threat Emulation Software Blade quickly inspects files and runs them in a virtual sandbox environment to discover malicious behavior, preventing identified malware from entering the network while automatically sharing threat intelligence with the broader security community.

## Security Architecture Context
Part of the SandBlast suite, this blade provides dynamic analysis capabilities by executing suspicious files in controlled virtual environments to identify previously unknown threats before they can impact the network.

## Key Capabilities
- **Virtual Sandbox Execution**: Runs suspicious files in isolated virtual environments
- **Malicious Behavior Detection**: Identifies threat activities through dynamic analysis
- **Network Protection**: Prevents discovered malware from entering protected networks
- **Threat Intelligence Sharing**: Automatically reports new threats to the security community
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Provides rapid file inspection and behavior assessment

## Intelligence Sharing
The emulation service automatically reports and shares newly identified threat information with other customers, contributing to collective security intelligence and improving protection across the entire user base.

## Integration Requirements
Requires Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) feature for SMTP traffic inspection, demonstrating integration with email security capabilities.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 Security Gateway Administration Guide (2022)
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor documentation
