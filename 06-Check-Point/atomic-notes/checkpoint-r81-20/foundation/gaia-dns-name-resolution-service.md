# Gaia DNS Name Resolution Service

## Core Concept
Gaia uses Domain Name Service (DNS) to translate host names into IP addresses through primary DNS server consultation with automatic failover to secondary and tertiary DNS servers upon failure or timeout, including DNS suffix configuration for host-name lookup searches, with R81+ support for Virtual System-specific DNS settings.

## Research Context
Network name resolution infrastructure for converting human-readable names to IP addresses, essential for network communication and service discovery in distributed environments.
