# Gaia Bond Interface Verification Proc Net

## Core Concept
Gaia Bond interface verification uses Expert mode access to /proc/net/bonding/<Bond Group ID> files displaying Ethernet Channel Bonding Driver status, MII status, polling intervals, delay settings, slave interface states, link failure counts, hardware addresses, and mode-specific information like LACP aggregator IDs and transmit hash policies.

## Research Context
System verification and troubleshooting methodology for confirming bond interface operational status and configuration accuracy, essential for diagnosing link aggregation issues.
