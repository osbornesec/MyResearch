# Identity Awareness Software Blade

## Core Concept
Identity Awareness maps users and computer identities beyond traditional IP address monitoring, enabling enforcement of Access Control policy rules and audit data based on actual user and computer identities rather than just network addresses.

## Security Architecture Context
Transforms traditional network-based security controls into identity-based security, providing granular user and computer awareness that enables more precise security policy enforcement and comprehensive audit capabilities.

## Key Capabilities
- **User Identity Mapping**: Associates network activity with specific user identities
- **Computer Identity Tracking**: Maps computer identities to network communications
- **Identity-Based Policy Enforcement**: Enables rules based on user/computer identity rather than just IP addresses
- **Enhanced Audit Data**: Provides identity context for all security logging and monitoring
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Works with both Active Directory and non-Active Directory networks
- **Guest User Support**: Accommodates both employees and guest users

## Deployment Characteristics
Designed as an easy-to-deploy and scalable solution that enhances traditional firewall capabilities without requiring complex infrastructure changes.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 Security Gateway Administration Guide (2022)
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor documentation

## Connection Potential
