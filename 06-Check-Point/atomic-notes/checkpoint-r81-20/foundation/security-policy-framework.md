# Security Policy Framework

## Core Concept
Security Policy is a comprehensive collection of rules and settings that control network traffic and enforce organizational guidelines for data protection and resource access through packet inspection.

## Security Architecture Context
Forms the fundamental control mechanism in Check Point architecture, defining how the Security Gateway evaluates and handles all network traffic according to organizational security requirements.

## Key Components
- **Rule Collections**: Organized sets of security rules for different protection areas
- **Traffic Control**: Granular control over network communications
- **Data Protection**: Enforcement of organizational data security guidelines  
- **Resource Access**: Management of user and system access to network resources
- **Packet Inspection**: Deep analysis of network traffic for security enforcement

## Policy Types Supported
Multiple specialized policy types address different security domains including access control, threat prevention, HTTPS inspection, data loss prevention, geographic restrictions, and mobile access.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 Security Gateway Administration Guide (2022)
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor documentation

## Connection Potential
Links to specific policy types (Access Control, Threat Prevention, etc.), rule base structures, Security Management Server distribution, and Security Gateway enforcement mechanisms.
