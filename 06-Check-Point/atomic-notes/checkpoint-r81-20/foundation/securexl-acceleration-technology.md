# SecureXL Acceleration Technology

## Core Concept
SecureXL is a traffic acceleration feature that enhances performance for traffic passing through Security Gateways, Cluster Members, and Scalable Platform Security Groups by optimizing packet processing for established connections.

## Security Architecture Context
Provides performance optimization while maintaining security integrity, enabling Security Gateways to handle higher traffic volumes without compromising security inspection capabilities.

## Key Characteristics
- **Traffic Acceleration**: Optimizes processing for established, trusted connections
- **Security Preservation**: Maintains full security inspection for new and suspicious traffic
- **Universal Deployment**: Functions across various Security Gateway deployment models
- **Performance Enhancement**: Increases throughput capacity without hardware changes
- **Transparent Operation**: Works without requiring changes to security policies or network topology

## Integration Requirements
Works in conjunction with CoreXL technology and Multi-Queue configurations to provide comprehensive performance optimization across multi-core processing platforms.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 Security Gateway Administration Guide (2022)
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor documentation
