# Network Feed Troubleshooting Procedures

## Core Management Concept
Network feed troubleshooting employs kernel debugging in Expert mode with specific module configurations (RAD_KERNEL, DOMO, UP) to collect diagnostic information about network feed matching and policy installation, requiring maintenance windows due to high CPU load impact.

## Administrative Context
This advanced diagnostic capability enables deep analysis of network feed operational issues through kernel-level debugging, providing detailed insight into dynamic object processing and policy installation behavior for complex troubleshooting scenarios.

## Implementation Details
- Configure kernel debug with fw ctl debug commands for buffer and module settings
- Enable RAD_KERNEL, DOMO, and UP modules for comprehensive network feed debugging
- Execute kernel debug capture using fw ctl kdebug with output redirection to log files
- Replicate problematic conditions during debug capture for issue correlation
- Stop debug capture and reset configuration to restore normal operation
- Apply procedures to all cluster members in clustered Security Gateway environments
- Schedule maintenance windows due to high CPU load impact during debug operation

## Integration Requirements
- Requires Expert mode access and kernel debug capabilities on Security Gateways
- Integrates with Quantum Security Gateway Guide kernel debug procedures
- Applies to cluster member coordination for comprehensive environment coverage
- Foundation for advanced network feed diagnostics and complex issue resolution workflows
