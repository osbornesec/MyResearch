# Gaia Hostname Domain Name Configuration

## Core Concept
Gaia hostname configuration sets the network name of the Gaia device established during initial setup but modifiable later, with optional domain name specification (e.g., example.com) using set hostname and set domainname commands, requiring save config for permanent storage.

## Research Context
System identification and network namespace configuration for DNS resolution and network communication, essential for proper system identification and name resolution.
