# Gaia IPv6 Static Routing Configuration

## Core Concept
Gaia IPv6 static routing requires system-wide IPv6 enablement and reboot, supports CIDR notation with mask lengths 8-128, provides next hop types (normal, blackhole, reject), uses priority-based gateway selection (1-8) without Equal Cost Multipath support, and includes ping6 monitoring using ICMPv6 Echo Requests for gateway verification.

## Research Context
IPv6 network routing implementation for modern dual-stack network environments, essential for IPv6 connectivity and next-generation network designs.
