# Gaia High-End Deployment Feature Support

## Core Concept
Gaia is designed from the ground up for modern high-end deployments with integrated support for IPv4/IPv6, high connection capacity via 64-bit Linux kernel, load sharing through ClusterXL and interface bonding, high availability via ClusterXL and VRRP, and dynamic/multicast routing protocols including BGP, OSPF, RIP, PIM-SM, PIM-DM, and IGMP.

## Research Context
Understanding the enterprise-grade capabilities built into Gaia OS that enable large-scale, mission-critical security deployments.
