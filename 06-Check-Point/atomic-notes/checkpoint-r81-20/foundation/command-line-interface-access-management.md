## Implementation Details
- Accessible via F9 keyboard shortcut from anywhere in SmartConsole
- Located at left bottom corner of SmartConsole interface
- Provides direct access to management scripting capabilities
- Enables API-based automation and programmatic control
- Supports complex configuration tasks requiring scripted execution

## Integration Requirements
- Integrates with Check Point management API framework
- Supports scripting languages for automation development
- Connects to all management functions accessible through SmartConsole
- Foundation for automation workflows and programmatic security management
