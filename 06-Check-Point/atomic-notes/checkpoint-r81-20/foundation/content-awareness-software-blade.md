# Content Awareness Software Blade

## Core Concept
The Content Awareness Software Blade provides data visibility and enforcement in unified Access Control Policy through deep content analysis, enabling organizations to control data flows based on content types and file classifications.

## Security Architecture Context
Integrates with Access Control Policy to provide granular data protection capabilities, enabling organizations to monitor and control sensitive information as it moves through the network.

## Key Capabilities
- **Data Visibility**: Comprehensive insight into data types flowing through the network
- **Unified Policy Enforcement**: Integration with Access Control Policy for consistent control
- **Directional Control**: Separate policies for download (into organization), upload (out of organization), or any direction
- **Content Classification**: Analysis of file content to identify sensitive data patterns
- **File Type Detection**: Classification based on file identifiers and formats

## Data Classification Types
- **Content Types**: Analyzed by examining file content (e.g., PCI credit card numbers, IBAN numbers)
- **File Types**: Classified by analyzing file identifiers (e.g., PDF, executable files, presentation files)

## Supported Services
Works with CheckPointExchangeAgent, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP_proxy, HTTPS_proxy, SMTP, and Squid_NTLM protocols.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 Security Gateway Administration Guide (2022)
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor documentation

## Connection Potential
Links to Data Loss Prevention integration, Access Control Policy framework, data classification systems, and protocol-specific content inspection mechanisms.
