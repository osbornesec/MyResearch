# VSX Virtual System Extension

## Core Concept
VSX (Virtual System eXtension) runs multiple virtual firewalls on the same hardware, with each Virtual System functioning as a complete Security Gateway that protects a specified network and applies independent security policies.

## Security Architecture Context
Enables consolidation of multiple security gateways onto a single hardware platform while maintaining complete isolation and independent security policies for each protected network segment.

## Key Capabilities
- **Multiple Virtual Firewalls**: Runs several independent virtual security systems on shared hardware
- **Network Segmentation**: Each Virtual System protects a specific network segment
- **Independent Policies**: Virtual Systems apply separate security policies according to their requirements
- **Traffic Routing**: VSX Gateway directs traffic to appropriate Virtual System based on destination network
- **Hardware Consolidation**: Reduces physical infrastructure while maintaining security isolation

## Virtual Network Components
VSX virtual networks include Virtual Systems (acting as Security Gateways), Warp Links (virtual interfaces and connections), and Virtual Switches (connecting Virtual Systems to external routers).

## Comparison to Physical Architecture
Replaces multiple physical Security Gateways with a single configurable VSX Gateway that defines and protects multiple independent networks through virtualization.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 Security Gateway Administration Guide (2022)
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor documentation

## Connection Potential
