# Command Line Reference Framework

## Core Management Concept
Command Line Reference provides standardized syntax conventions and administrative command structures for Check Point security management, utilizing specific notation including curly brackets for option selection, angle brackets for variables, and square brackets for optional parameters.

## Administrative Context
This essential reference framework enables administrators to execute automated management tasks and system administration through structured command-line interfaces, supporting scripting, automation, and advanced configuration scenarios beyond GUI capabilities.

## Implementation Details
- TAB notation shows available nested subcommands in hierarchical command structures
- Curly brackets {} enclose mutually exclusive command or parameter options
- Angle brackets <> indicate required variables requiring explicit value specification
- Square brackets [] denote optional commands or parameters for flexible command construction
- Alphabetical ordering of commands, parameters, and options for systematic navigation
- Integration with R81.20 CLI Reference Guide for comprehensive command documentation

## Integration Requirements
- Requires CLI Reference Guide for complete command documentation
- Integrates with Expert mode access for command execution
- Supports automation and scripting workflows for administrative efficiency
- Foundation for programmatic management and advanced administrative procedures
