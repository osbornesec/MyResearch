# License Management Automation

## Core Management Concept
License management provides automatic activation after First Time Configuration Wizard completion and User Center connectivity, with automatic synchronization of Management Software Blade license changes, retry intervals for failed activations, and proxy configuration for offline environments.

## Administrative Context

## Implementation Details
- Automatic license activation following First Time Configuration Wizard completion
- User Center connectivity requirement for initial license activation
- Retry mechanism with intervals for failed activation attempts due to connectivity issues
- Automatic synchronization of Management Software Blade license changes from User Center
- Check Point appliance-only support for automatic activation functionality
- R80.30 and higher server support for automatic synchronization
- Proxy server configuration recommendation for Internet-disconnected environments
- Internet-connected Check Point server proxy capability for User Center synchronization

## Integration Requirements
- Requires User Center connectivity for license activation and synchronization
- Integrates with First Time Configuration Wizard for initial setup
- Supports proxy configuration for environments with limited Internet access
- Foundation for automated license compliance and centralized license management workflows
