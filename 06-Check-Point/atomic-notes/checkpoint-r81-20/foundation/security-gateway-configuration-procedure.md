# Security Gateway Configuration Procedure

## Core Management Concept
Security Gateway configuration involves accessing the Gateways & Servers view, creating new gateway objects through the New Gateway option, and selecting either Wizard Mode for guided configuration or Classic Mode for traditional settings management.

## Administrative Context
This essential gateway deployment procedure establishes the enforcement points where security policies are applied to network traffic, enabling administrators to extend centralized security management to distributed network locations.

## Implementation Details
- Access configuration through Gateways & Servers navigation toolbar selection
- Initiate gateway creation using New button and Gateway selection
- Choose configuration approach through Check Point Security Gateway Creation window
- Wizard Mode: Provides guided configuration process for simplified setup
- Classic Mode: Offers traditional configuration interface for detailed control
- Supports multiple gateway types including physical and virtual deployments

## Integration Requirements
- Requires access to Gateways & Servers view in SmartConsole
- Integrates with Security Management Server for centralized management
- Connects to gateway management workflows for ongoing administration
- Foundation for distributed security policy enforcement and network protection
