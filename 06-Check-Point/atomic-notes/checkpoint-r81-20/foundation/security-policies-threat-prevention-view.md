# Security Policies Threat Prevention View

## Core Management Concept
The Security Policies Threat Prevention view provides centralized management of advanced threat protection including IPS (Intrusion Prevention System), Anti-Bot, Anti-Virus, Threat Emulation, unified threat rule base configuration, threat profiles, and exception management through Custom Policy Tools.

## Administrative Context
This specialized policy view focuses on advanced threat detection and prevention capabilities, enabling administrators to configure sophisticated security measures that protect against malware, intrusions, bot networks, and emerging threats through multiple complementary security technologies.

## Implementation Details
- Manage Threat Prevention policies across multiple security technologies
- Configure IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) rules and signatures
- Set up Anti-Bot policies for botnet detection and prevention
- Configure Anti-Virus scanning and malware protection
- Manage Threat Emulation for advanced threat analysis
- Edit unified threat rule base for comprehensive threat coverage
- Configure threat profiles for customized protection levels
- Add, edit, or delete exceptions and exception groups for policy fine-tuning
- Access Custom Policy Tools for specialized threat prevention configuration

## Integration Requirements
- Integrates with Security Gateways for threat enforcement
- Connects to threat intelligence feeds for updated protection signatures
- Supports threat emulation infrastructure for advanced analysis
- Foundation for all advanced threat detection and prevention workflows
