# Gaia Configuration Persistence Save Config

## Core Concept
In Gaia Clish, configuration changes are applied immediately to the running system only, and to ensure changes survive a reboot, administrators must explicitly run the "save config" command to persist configuration to permanent storage.

## Research Context
Critical configuration management concept for ensuring persistence of administrative changes, essential for preventing configuration loss after system restarts.
