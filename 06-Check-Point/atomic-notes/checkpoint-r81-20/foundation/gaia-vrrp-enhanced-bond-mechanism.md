# Gaia VRRP Enhanced Bond Mechanism

## Core Concept
Gaia R80.20+ Enhanced Bond mechanism for Active/Backup bonding is enabled by default in ClusterXL but requires manual activation in VRRP clusters using kernel parameter fwha_bond_enhanced_enable=1, configured temporarily via fw ctl commands or permanently through $FWDIR/boot/modules/fwkern.conf file modification.

## Research Context
Cluster-specific bond optimization feature for improving failover performance in VRRP environments, essential for maintaining high availability in non-ClusterXL clustering configurations.
