# Distributed Security Deployment

## Core Concept
Distributed Deployment is a configuration where Check Point Security Gateway and Security Management Server products are installed on different computers, enabling separation of management and enforcement functions across the network infrastructure.

## Security Architecture Context
Provides architectural flexibility and scalability by separating policy management functions from policy enforcement, enabling centralized control over distributed security enforcement points.

## Key Benefits
- **Functional Separation**: Isolates management plane from enforcement plane operations
- **Scalability Enhancement**: Enables single management server to control multiple gateways
- **Geographic Distribution**: Supports security gateways across multiple locations
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces resource contention between management and enforcement
- **Security Isolation**: Provides additional security through functional separation

## Deployment Considerations
Requires network connectivity between Security Management Server and distributed Security Gateways for policy distribution, status monitoring, and log collection.

## Contrast to Standalone Deployment
Alternative to configurations where management and gateway functions are co-located on the same hardware platform.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 Security Gateway Administration Guide (2022)
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor documentation
