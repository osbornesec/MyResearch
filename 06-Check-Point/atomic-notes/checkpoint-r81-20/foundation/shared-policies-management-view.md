# Shared Policies Management View

## Core Management Concept
The Shared Policies view enables management of specialized security policies that can be shared across multiple gateways and deployments, including Mobile Access, DLP (Data Loss Prevention), Geo Policy, and Inspection Settings configurations.

## Administrative Context
This specialized management view focuses on policies that require consistent application across multiple enforcement points, enabling administrators to define reusable security configurations that maintain consistency and reduce administrative overhead in distributed deployments.

## Implementation Details
- Manage Mobile Access policies for remote connectivity standardization
- Configure DLP (Data Loss Prevention) policies for data protection
- Set up Geo Policy rules for geographic-based access control
- Define Inspection Settings profiles for consistent traffic analysis
- Create shared configurations that can be applied across multiple gateways
- Maintain policy consistency across distributed security infrastructure

## Integration Requirements
- Integrates with multiple Security Gateways for shared policy deployment
- Connects to mobile access infrastructure for remote access control
- Supports geographic databases for location-based policy enforcement
- Foundation for standardized policy deployment and management efficiency
