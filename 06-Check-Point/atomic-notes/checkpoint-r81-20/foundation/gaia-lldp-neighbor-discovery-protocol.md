# Gaia LLDP Neighbor Discovery Protocol

## Core Concept
Gaia supports Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) for network neighbor discovery with configurable interface modes (receive, transmit, transmit-and-receive), TLV information sharing (port description, system name, system description, system capabilities, management address), and configurable timers for packet transmission intervals and TTL multipliers.

## Research Context
Network discovery and documentation capability for automatic topology mapping and neighbor identification, essential for network troubleshooting and infrastructure documentation.
