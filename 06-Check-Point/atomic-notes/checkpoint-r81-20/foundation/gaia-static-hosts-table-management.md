# Gaia Static Hosts Table Management

## Core Concept
Gaia static hosts table allows adding host addresses for systems that communicate frequently with the Gaia system, supporting IPv4 and IPv6 addresses with host names restricted to alphanumeric characters, dashes, and periods (periods must be followed by letter/digit, names cannot end with dash or period), enabling view, add, modify, and delete operations.

## Research Context
Local name resolution enhancement for frequently accessed systems, essential for reducing DNS lookup overhead and providing reliable name resolution for critical network resources.
