# RIP Distance Vector Protocol Inherent Limitations

## Core Concept
RIP uses only hop count metric (maximum 15 hops) ignoring network congestion and link speed, resulting in excessive network traffic from periodic routing table broadcasts, slow convergence time, and reduced security compared to link-state protocols like OSPF.

## Research Context
Understanding fundamental distance-vector protocol limitations essential for appropriate protocol selection in enterprise environments, particularly when comparing against more sophisticated link-state alternatives.
