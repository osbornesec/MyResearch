# Gaia Dynamic Multicast Routing Protocol Support

## Core Concept
Gaia OS implements comprehensive multicast routing through PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast) in three operational modes: Sparse Mode (SM), Dense Mode (DM), and Source-Specific Multicast (SSM), plus IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) for multicast group management.

## Research Context
Advanced multicast routing capabilities essential for enterprise environments requiring efficient one-to-many and many-to-many communication patterns, particularly relevant for video streaming, software distribution, and real-time communication applications.
