# DHCP Relay Wait Time Local Server Prioritization

## Core Concept
DHCP Relay wait time parameter (1-65535 seconds, default 0) provides local DHCP servers priority opportunity to respond before forwarding requests to remote servers, optimizing response times and network traffic.

## Research Context
Performance optimization mechanism for hybrid DHCP environments where both local and remote DHCP servers exist, enabling intelligent traffic flow and response time optimization.
