# BGP 4-Byte Autonomous System Number Support

## Core Concept
BGP 4-Byte AS feature enables configuration of 32-bit autonomous system numbers (1-4294967295 or dotted notation 0.1-65535.65535), permanently enabled by default to support extended AS number space beyond traditional 16-bit limitations.

## Research Context
Critical capability for modern internet routing addressing AS number exhaustion, enabling participation in contemporary BGP networks that require extended AS number space for global internet growth.
