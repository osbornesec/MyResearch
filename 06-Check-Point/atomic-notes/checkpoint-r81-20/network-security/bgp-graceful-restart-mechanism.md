# BGP Graceful Restart High Availability Mechanism

## Core Concept
BGP Graceful Restart maintains routing table stability during planned and unplanned BGP process restarts through coordinated timer mechanisms (restart time 1-4095 seconds, selection deferral time 60-4095 seconds) enabling non-disruptive maintenance operations.

## Research Context
Critical high availability feature preventing network disruption during BGP process maintenance or cluster failover events, essential for enterprise environments requiring continuous connectivity during software updates or hardware maintenance.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point Gaia Advanced Routing Guide R81.20
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10 (Official vendor documentation)
- **Validation Method**: Authoritative Check Point technical documentation with specific timer references

## Connection Potential
- Links to BGP high availability and stability concepts
- Connects to planned maintenance and update procedures
- Associates with cluster failover and redundancy mechanisms
- Relates to network service continuity and business continuity planning
