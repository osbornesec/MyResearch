# BGP Router ID Configuration Best Practices

## Core Concept
BGP Router ID should be explicitly configured using a dedicated loopback interface address (127.0.0.x/24 subnet, not 127.0.0.1) rather than relying on default interface address selection, ensuring stability across interface state changes.

## Research Context
Critical BGP stability practice preventing router ID changes that can disrupt BGP sessions and routing table consistency, particularly important in enterprise environments with dynamic interface configurations.
