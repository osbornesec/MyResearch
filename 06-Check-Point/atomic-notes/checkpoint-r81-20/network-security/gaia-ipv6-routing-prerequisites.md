# Gaia IPv6 Routing Configuration Prerequisites

## Core Concept
IPv6 routing functionality in Gaia OS requires explicit enablement of IPv6 support followed by a system reboot before IPv6 addresses and static routes can be configured, establishing the foundation for IPv6 routing protocols.

## Research Context
Critical prerequisite step for modern network deployments requiring IPv6 support, ensuring proper protocol stack initialization before advanced IPv6 routing protocols can be implemented.
