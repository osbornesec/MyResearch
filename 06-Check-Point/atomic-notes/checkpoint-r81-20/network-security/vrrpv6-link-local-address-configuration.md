# VRRPv6 Link-Local Address Configuration Pattern

## Core Concept
VRRPv6 implementation requires configuration of both link-local (fe80::/10) and link-global VIP addresses, with the link-local address serving as the monitored circuit address on the same subnet as the protected hosts.

## Research Context
Essential IPv6 VRRP configuration pattern ensuring proper neighbor discovery and local segment reachability while maintaining global IPv6 connectivity through the link-global address.
