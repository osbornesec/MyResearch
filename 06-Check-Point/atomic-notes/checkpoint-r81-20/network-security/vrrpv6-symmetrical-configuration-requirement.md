# VRRPv6 Symmetrical Configuration Requirement

## Core Concept
When both IPv6 and IPv4 VRRP are configured on Gaia systems, they must maintain symmetrical configuration in terms of master state and failover behavior, ensuring consistent high availability operations across both protocol stacks.

## Research Context
Critical design requirement for dual-stack high availability deployments, preventing split-brain scenarios where IPv4 and IPv6 VRRP instances have conflicting master/backup states.
