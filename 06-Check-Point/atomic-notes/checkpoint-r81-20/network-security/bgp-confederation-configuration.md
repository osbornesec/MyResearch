# BGP Confederation Configuration Architecture

## Core Concept
BGP confederation enables AS subdivision using globally unique confederation ID for external sessions while internal routing domain identifiers (RDI) provide unique internal AS numbers, supporting AS path loop prevention through configurable loop count limits.

## Research Context
Advanced BGP scaling technique for large autonomous systems requiring internal structure and policy control while presenting unified external AS identity, essential for enterprise networks with complex internal routing requirements.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point Gaia Advanced Routing Guide R81.20
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10 (Official vendor documentation)
- **Validation Method**: Authoritative Check Point technical documentation

## Connection Potential
- Links to autonomous system design and scaling concepts
- Connects to AS path manipulation and loop prevention
- Associates with enterprise network hierarchy and policy
- Relates to BGP confederation peers and internal routing strategies
