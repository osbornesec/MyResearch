# BGP Path Vector Routing for Policy-Based Internet Connectivity

## Core Concept
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) operates as an inter-AS protocol deployable both within and between autonomous systems, enabling policy-based routing through AS path vector information and TCP-based reliable transport mechanisms.

## Research Context
Fundamental understanding of BGP as the core internet routing protocol, essential for enterprise WAN connectivity, multi-provider environments, and sophisticated routing policy implementation in Check Point deployments.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point Gaia Advanced Routing Guide R81.20
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10 (Official vendor documentation)
- **Validation Method**: BGP version 4 with Multiprotocol Extensions compliance

## Established Connections
- `[[autonomous-system-design-principles]]` - Fundamental AS architecture concepts
- `[[igp-bgp-redistribution-patterns]]` - Interior gateway protocol integration
- `[[internet-routing-policy-framework]]` - Global routing policy and governance
- `[[tcp-reliable-transport-mechanisms]]` - Underlying transport protocol reliability

## Synthesis Insights
BGP's path vector approach enables sophisticated routing policies based on AS path attributes rather than simple metrics, making it essential for enterprise internet connectivity, multi-homing scenarios, and traffic engineering across provider boundaries while maintaining loop-free interdomain routing.
