# BGP Route Reflection Cluster ID Management

## Core Concept
BGP route reflection requires unique cluster ID configuration when multiple route reflectors serve the same cluster for redundancy, overriding the default router ID to prevent routing loops and enable proper cluster identification.

## Research Context
Advanced BGP scaling mechanism enabling iBGP mesh reduction through controlled route advertisement, essential for large enterprise networks requiring BGP scalability without full mesh connectivity.
