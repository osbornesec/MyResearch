# DHCP Relay Multi-Hop Network Extension

## Core Concept
BOOTP/DHCP Relay extends Bootstrap Protocol and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol operations across multiple network hops in routed environments, enabling centralized DHCP server management across segmented networks.

## Research Context
Essential network service extension for enterprise environments where DHCP servers cannot be placed on every network segment, enabling centralized IP address management and configuration distribution.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point Gaia Advanced Routing Guide R81.20
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10 (Official vendor documentation)
- **Validation Method**: RFC compliance (951, 1542, 2131) and authoritative documentation

## Connection Potential
- Links to DHCP server centralization strategies
- Connects to network segmentation and VLAN concepts
- Associates with enterprise IP address management
- Relates to network service distribution patterns
