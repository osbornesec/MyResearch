# IKE Forwarding Mechanism in ClusterXL

## Core Concept

IKE Forwarding ensures consistent VPN negotiation handling in Check Point ClusterXL Load Sharing mode by directing all IKE packets for a specific negotiation to the same cluster member, preventing fragmented negotiations across multiple members.

## Technical Implementation

**SEP_my_IKE_packet Table**: Records unknown first IKE packets with cookie+message_id as key and cluster peer IP as value, maintaining negotiation ownership.

**Cookie-Based Routing**: Each IKE negotiation uses unique cookies that remain valid throughout Phase 1, enabling proper packet forwarding to the correct cluster member.

**Forwarding Logic**: 
- If local member owns negotiation: Handle normally
- If remote member owns negotiation: Forward packet to correct peer
- If no ownership exists: Current member takes ownership

## Load Sharing Coordination

In Load Sharing clusters, IKE packets may arrive at different cluster members due to internal decision function distribution. The forwarding mechanism ensures the entire negotiation remains with the original handling member.

## Phase 2 Considerations

IKE Phase 2 packets check for existing IKE SA keys and forward to the Phase 1 handling member if keys are not yet synchronized, maintaining negotiation continuity.
