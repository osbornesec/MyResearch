# NAT Troubleshooting Methodology

## Core Concept

NAT troubleshooting in Check Point Security Gateways follows systematic analysis of rule matching, connection recording, and packet transformation to identify translation failures and configuration issues.

## Connection Matching Process

**First Packet Analysis**: Initial packet matching occurs against both Security Rule base and NAT Rule base, with results recorded for the entire connection lifetime.

**Connection Recording**: Firewall maintains bidirectional connection state, eliminating need for explicit back-connection configuration in most scenarios.

**Rule Priority**: Pre-manual rules → Automatic rules (Static before Hide) → Post-manual rules

## Debugging Methodology

**Kernel Debug Prerequisites**: Disable SecureXL before debugging, monitor CPU utilization to prevent system overload, and use targeted filtering to reduce debug overhead.

**Firewall Monitor**: `fw monitor -e "accept;" -o outputfile.cap` with INSPECT syntax filtering for specific traffic analysis.

**Connection Table Analysis**: Examine active connections to verify NAT rule application and translation accuracy.

## Common Issue Patterns

**Missing Back Connections**: Only required when internal servers initiate outbound connections using their translated identity.

**Rule Matching Failures**: Verify original and translated packet specifications match actual traffic flow patterns.

**Automatic vs Manual Rules**: Understand precedence relationships and when to use each configuration method.

## Systematic Flow Analysis

Troubleshooting follows defined workflow: Verify traffic arrival → Check rule matching → Analyze connection recording → Validate translation accuracy → Review rule precedence.
