# RIPv2 Variable Length Subnet Mask Support

## Core Concept
RIPv2 enhances RIPv1 by explicitly specifying network masks for each network in routing packets, overcoming RIPv1's assumption that all subnets within a network use identical masks and enabling support for Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM).

## Research Context
Critical RIPv2 enhancement enabling modern subnetting strategies and efficient IP address utilization through VLSM support, essential for contemporary network design requiring flexible subnet allocation.
