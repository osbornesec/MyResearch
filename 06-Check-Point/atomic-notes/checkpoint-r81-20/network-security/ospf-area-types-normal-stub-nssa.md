# OSPF Hierarchical Area Design Optimization Strategy

## Core Concept
OSPF supports three area types for network design optimization: Normal areas (all LSAs), Stub areas (no Type 5 LSAs, default routing for external destinations), and NSSA areas (Type 7 LSAs for limited external route import), with backbone area (0.0.0.0) always remaining normal.

## Research Context
Essential OSPF hierarchical design concept enabling network segmentation, routing table size optimization, and controlled external route propagation through strategic area type selection based on connectivity requirements.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point Gaia Advanced Routing Guide R81.20
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10 (Official vendor documentation)
- **Validation Method**: Authoritative Check Point technical documentation

## Synthesis Insights
OSPF area type selection enables intelligent trade-offs between routing table completeness and scalability: Normal areas provide full routing visibility, Stub areas optimize table size through external route exclusion, and NSSA areas balance both by allowing selective external route import while maintaining summarization benefits.
