# OSPF Interior Gateway Protocol Architecture

## Core Concept
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) for single autonomous system routing using true cost-based metrics rather than hop count, providing faster convergence and equal-cost multipath routing capabilities compared to distance-vector protocols like RIP.

## Research Context
Fundamental link-state routing protocol essential for enterprise networks requiring efficient, scalable, and fast-converging interior routing with sophisticated metric-based path selection and multipath capabilities.
