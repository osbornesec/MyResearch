# DHCP Relay Primary Address Stamping Mechanism

## Core Concept
DHCP Relay stamps forwarded requests with either a specified primary IPv4 address or the lowest numeric IP address on the interface, enabling proper DHCP server response routing and supporting multi-alias interface configurations.

## Research Context
Technical mechanism essential for proper DHCP relay operation in complex network topologies with multiple IP addresses per interface, ensuring reliable response delivery and server communication.
