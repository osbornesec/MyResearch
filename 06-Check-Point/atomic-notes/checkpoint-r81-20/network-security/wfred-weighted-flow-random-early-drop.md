# WFRED Weighted Flow Random Early Drop

## Core Concept
WFRED (Weighted Flow Random Early Drop) is a mechanism for managing packet buffers in QoS that automatically and dynamically adjusts to network traffic situations while remaining transparent to users.

## Operational Characteristics
- **Automatic Adaptation**: Dynamically adjusts to changing network traffic conditions
- **User Transparency**: Buffer management occurs without visible impact to end users
- **Flow-Based Weighting**: Applies different drop probabilities based on flow characteristics
- **Early Drop Strategy**: Proactively drops packets before buffers become completely full

## Buffer Management Function
- **Congestion Prevention**: Prevents buffer overflow by intelligently dropping packets
- **Quality Preservation**: Maintains traffic quality by avoiding complete buffer saturation
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjusts drop thresholds based on current traffic patterns
- **Flow Awareness**: Considers individual flow characteristics in drop decisions

## Integration with QoS
- **WFQ Complement**: Works alongside Weighted Fair Queuing for complete traffic management
- **Buffer Optimization**: Ensures efficient use of available buffer space
- **Performance Enhancement**: Contributes to overall QoS performance optimization
- **Transparent Operation**: Functions without requiring explicit configuration

## Traffic Situation Adaptation
- **Load-Based Adjustment**: Modifies behavior based on current network load
- **Pattern Recognition**: Adapts to different traffic patterns and characteristics
- **Real-Time Response**: Provides immediate response to changing conditions
- **Stability Maintenance**: Helps maintain stable network performance under varying loads

## Research Context
Advanced QoS buffer management mechanism that provides intelligent packet dropping to prevent congestion while maintaining optimal network performance.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 QoS Administration Guide (Glossary)
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor technical documentation

## Connection Potential
- Links to Weighted Fair Queuing algorithm and buffer management
