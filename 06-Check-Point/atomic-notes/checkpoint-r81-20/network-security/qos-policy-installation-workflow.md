# QoS Policy Installation Workflow

## Core Concept
QoS policy installation is a multi-step process that validates rules and objects before deploying traffic management policies to Security Gateways for enforcement.

## Installation Prerequisites
- **QoS Blade Enabled**: QoS Software Blade must be enabled on target Security Gateway
- **Interface Configuration**: At least one interface must have QoS enabled for successful installation
- **Policy Validation**: All rules and objects must pass verification before installation

## Installation Process Steps
1. **SmartDashboard Changes**: Make policy rule modifications in SmartDashboard
2. **Update Session**: Click Update to save changes to SmartConsole session
3. **SmartConsole Installation**: Use SmartConsole Install Policy function
4. **Policy Selection**: Select specific QoS policy to install from policy list
5. **Target Selection**: Choose Security Gateways for policy deployment
6. **Installation Execution**: Execute installation process with validation

## Target Selection Requirements
- **Manual Selection**: No gateways selected by default for QoS policies
- **Explicit Configuration**: Administrator must manually select target gateways
- **Multiple Targets**: Can install on multiple Security Gateways simultaneously
- **Individual Control**: Each gateway can receive different policy configurations

## Validation and Error Handling
- **Automatic Validation**: Installation process validates all rules and objects
- **Error Reporting**: Verification errors displayed in Install Policy Details tab
- **Failure Handling**: Installation fails if validation errors detected
- **Error Resolution**: All errors must be resolved before successful installation

## Error Diagnosis Process
1. **Task Information Access**: Click Task Information area in lower-left SmartConsole
2. **Recent Tasks Review**: Locate failed installation in Recent Tasks area
3. **Details Examination**: Click Details to view specific error information
4. **Status Analysis**: Expand Status column for detailed error messages

## Post-Installation Verification
- **Policy Enforcement**: Security Gateways begin enforcing QoS rules after successful installation
- **Traffic Monitoring**: Monitor QoS traffic management through Logs & Monitor view
- **Performance Validation**: Verify bandwidth allocation matches configured policies

## Research Context
Critical operational procedure that deploys QoS policies from management server to enforcement points, enabling actual traffic management implementation.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point R81.20 QoS Administration Guide
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10
- **Validation Method**: Official vendor operational documentation

## Connection Potential
- Links to SmartConsole management interface and Security Gateway configuration
- Connects to QoS policy development and rule validation processes
- Relates to change management and operational procedures
