# DHCP Relay Redundancy and Load Balancing Capabilities

## Core Concept
DHCP Relay provides redundancy through simultaneous forwarding to multiple servers per interface and load balancing through distribution across multiple interfaces, enabling high availability and performance optimization for DHCP services.

## Research Context
Critical enterprise network design patterns for ensuring DHCP service availability and optimal performance distribution across large-scale network infrastructures.
