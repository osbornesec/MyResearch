# OSPF Router ID Cluster Configuration Requirements

## Core Concept
OSPF Router ID in cluster environments must be configured to one of the Cluster Virtual IP addresses and maintained identically across all cluster members, ensuring consistent router identification during failover operations.

## Research Context
Critical high availability configuration requirement for OSPF deployment in Check Point clusters, ensuring routing protocol stability and neighbor relationships during cluster failover events.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point Gaia Advanced Routing Guide R81.20
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10 (Official vendor documentation)
- **Validation Method**: Authoritative Check Point technical documentation with specific cluster requirements

## Connection Potential
- Links to cluster high availability mechanisms
- Connects to OSPF neighbor relationship stability
- Associates with virtual IP address management concepts
- Relates to routing protocol failover and redundancy strategies
