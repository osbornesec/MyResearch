# OSPF ClusterXL Virtual Router Behavior

## Core Concept
In ClusterXL environments, OSPF creates a virtual router using cluster Virtual IP address as router ID, with only the master member actively exchanging routing information while maintaining synchronized routing database across all cluster members for seamless failover.

## Research Context
Advanced cluster integration ensuring OSPF protocol compatibility with Check Point high availability mechanisms, enabling transparent routing operations during cluster failover with minimal traffic disruption.
