# Gaia IPv6 Management Interface Configuration Limitation

## Core Concept
Check Point Gaia R81.20 has a known limitation (PMTR-47313) that prevents IPv6 address assignment on the Gaia Management Interface, restricting IPv6 management capabilities to data interfaces only.

## Research Context
Critical deployment constraint for IPv6-enabled Check Point environments, requiring alternative management access strategies when IPv6-only network segments need to manage security gateways.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point Gaia Advanced Routing Guide R81.20
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10 (Official vendor documentation)
- **Validation Method**: Authoritative Check Point technical documentation with specific limitation tracking

## Connection Potential
- Links to IPv6 deployment planning considerations
- Connects to management network architecture patterns
- Associates with out-of-band management strategies
- Relates to IPv6 transition planning limitations
