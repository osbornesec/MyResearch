# DHCP Relay Maximum Hops Loop Prevention

## Core Concept
DHCP Relay maximum hops parameter (1-16 range, default 4) prevents infinite relay loops by incrementing and comparing hop counts, discarding requests that exceed the configured maximum hop threshold.

## Research Context
Critical loop prevention mechanism for complex network topologies with multiple DHCP relay agents, ensuring network stability and preventing broadcast storms in interconnected relay scenarios.
