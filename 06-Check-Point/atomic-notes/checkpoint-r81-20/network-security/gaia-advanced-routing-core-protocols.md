# Dynamic Routing Protocol Triad in Enterprise Security Gateways

## Core Concept
Gaia OS provides native support for three primary dynamic routing protocols: OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), and RIP (Routing Information Protocol), enabling advanced network routing capabilities beyond basic static routing.

## Research Context
Foundation protocol support that enables advanced routing scenarios in Check Point security gateway deployments, extending beyond basic network connectivity to sophisticated routing policy and traffic engineering.

## Source Quality
- **Primary Source**: Check Point Gaia Advanced Routing Guide R81.20
- **Credibility Score**: 9/10 (Official vendor documentation)
- **Validation Method**: Authoritative Check Point technical documentation

## Established Connections
- `[[gaia-os-foundation-concepts]]` - Builds upon basic Gaia networking stack
- `[[network-security-policy-integration]]` - Enables security-aware routing decisions  
- `[[clustered-routing-high-availability]]` - Supports redundant gateway deployments

## Synthesis Insights
The triad of OSPF, BGP, and RIP provides complementary capabilities: OSPF for intra-AS link-state efficiency, BGP for inter-AS policy routing, and RIP for simple legacy compatibility, enabling comprehensive enterprise routing scenarios from campus networks to internet edge connectivity.
