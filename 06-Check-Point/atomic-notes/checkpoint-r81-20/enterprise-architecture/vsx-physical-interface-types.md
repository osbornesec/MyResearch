# VSX Physical Interface Types

## Core Concept
Physical interfaces connect a VSX Gateway to Management Server and to internal and external networks. VSX Gateway supports multiple specialized physical interface types for different connectivity requirements.

## Interface Types
- **Dedicated Management Interface**: Connects VSX Gateway to Management Server for local management
- **External Interface**: Connects VSX Gateway to Internet or other untrusted networks
- **Internal Interface**: Connects VSX Gateway to protected networks
- **Synchronization Interface**: Connects VSX Cluster Members for state synchronization

## Scalability Characteristics
A VSX Gateway can contain as many physical interfaces as permitted by hardware and memory constraints, enabling flexible network connectivity.

## Research Context
Foundation connectivity layer that enables VSX Gateway integration with existing network infrastructure and management systems.
