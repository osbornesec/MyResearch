# VLAN Interface Virtual System Connectivity

## Core Concept
Virtual Systems typically connect to protected VLAN networks using IEEE 802.1q compliant VLAN Interfaces. VSX uses VLAN tags to direct Ethernet frames to the specific Virtual System handling each network.

## Technical Implementation
- Networks connect to 802.1q-compliant switch ports that trunk all traffic via single physical interface
- VSX assigns virtual VLAN interface to each VLAN tag on specific physical interface
- Interface naming convention: VLAN tag + physical interface (e.g., eth3.100 for VLAN tag 100 on eth3)

## Traffic Direction Mechanism
VLAN tags enable precise traffic routing to appropriate Virtual Systems without requiring separate physical interfaces for each protected network.

## Research Context
Key mechanism for efficient network segmentation and Virtual System connectivity in enterprise VLAN environments.
