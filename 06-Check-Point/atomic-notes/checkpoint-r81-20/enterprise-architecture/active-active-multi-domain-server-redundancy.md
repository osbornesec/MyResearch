# Active/Active Multi-Domain Server Redundancy Pattern

## Core Concept
Multi-Domain Server High Availability implements an Active/Active redundancy solution using two or more fully synchronized Multi-Domain Servers for continuous redundancy with all servers maintaining active status.

## Active/Active Architecture
- **All Servers Active**: Every Multi-Domain Server in the deployment accepts connections and processes requests
- **Full Synchronization**: Complete policy, rule, object, and configuration synchronization across all servers
- **Geographic Distribution**: Multiple active servers can be distributed across geographic locations
- **Continuous Redundancy**: No single point of failure in the management infrastructure

## Deployment Benefits
- **Load Distribution**: Administrators can connect to any Multi-Domain Server in the deployment
- **Geographic Optimization**: Connection to nearest Multi-Domain Server for optimal performance
- **Redundancy Without Waste**: All servers actively participate rather than standby idle resources
- **Transparent Failover**: Automatic redirection to operational servers without service interruption

## Synchronization Architecture
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Changes propagate automatically when administrators publish sessions
- **Policy Synchronization**: Security policies replicated across all active servers
- **Object Synchronization**: Network objects and configuration settings maintained consistently
- **Session Publication Triggers**: Synchronization occurs on policy, object, or configuration changes

## Enterprise Scalability
- **Multiple Server Support**: Two or more servers in active configuration
- **Geographic Scaling**: Support for international deployments with local server access
- **Administrative Scaling**: Multiple concurrent administrators across different servers
- **Performance Scaling**: Distributed processing load across multiple active servers

## Operational Characteristics
- **Primary/Secondary Installation Order**: First server designated Primary, others Secondary in installation
- **Consistent Configuration**: All servers maintain identical policy and configuration state
- **Distributed Management**: Any server can serve as management point for entire environment
- **Fault Tolerance**: System continues operation despite individual server failures

## Connection Potential
- Links to Domain Management Server High Availability patterns
- Connects to Multi-Site High Availability deployment
- Relates to Load Sharing configuration strategies
- Associates with geographic optimization deployment patterns
