# Warp Link Virtual Connection

## Core Concept
A Warp Link is a virtual point-to-point connection between a Virtual System and a Virtual Router or Virtual Switch. Each side represents a virtual interface with the appropriate Virtual Device.

## Interface Naming Convention
- Virtual System side interfaces: prefix "wrp" + unique number
- Virtual Router/Virtual Switch side interfaces: prefix "wrpj" + unique number
- When connected to Virtual Switch: unique MAC address assigned to each Warp Link

## Technical Characteristics
VSX automatically assigns names to virtual interfaces when administrators create the link, providing seamless virtual connectivity between components.

## Research Context
Critical connectivity mechanism that enables communication between virtual network components within VSX architecture.
