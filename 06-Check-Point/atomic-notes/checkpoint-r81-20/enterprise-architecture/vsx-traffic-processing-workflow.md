# VSX Traffic Processing Workflow

## Core Concept
A VSX Gateway processes traffic according to three sequential steps: Context Determination, Security Enforcement, and Forwarding to Destination.

## Processing Steps
1. **Context Determination**: Direct traffic to appropriate Virtual System, Virtual Router, or Virtual Switch
2. **Security Enforcement**: Virtual System applies its independent security policy to inspect and filter traffic
3. **Forwarding to Destination**: Virtual System processes and forwards traffic according to its unique configuration

## Independence Characteristics
Each Virtual System functions as independent Security Gateway with its own security policy, NAT rules, VPN configuration, and forwarding rules.

## Research Context
Core traffic processing framework that ensures proper isolation, security enforcement, and routing across virtual network environments.
