# Global Domain Policy Architecture

## Core Concept
The Global Domain provides common security policies and configuration settings that apply to all or specified domains, enabling enterprise-wide policy standardization and consistency.

## Global Policy Components
- **Common Security Policies**: Standardized policies applicable across multiple domains
- **Global Network Objects**: Shared objects accessible to all or specified domains
- **Global Configuration Settings**: System-wide configurations and standards
- **Cross-Domain Rules**: Policies that govern inter-domain communication

## Enterprise Standardization Benefits
- **Policy Consistency**: Uniform security standards across diverse domains
- **Administrative Efficiency**: Single point for enterprise-wide policy management
- **Compliance Alignment**: Centralized enforcement of regulatory requirements
- **Security Baseline**: Minimum security standards applied globally

## Deployment Flexibility
- **Universal Application**: Policies applied to all domains automatically
- **Selective Application**: Policies targeted to specific domains or domain groups
- **Override Capabilities**: Domain-specific policies can supplement or override global policies
- **Inheritance Model**: Domains inherit global settings while maintaining local autonomy

## Operational Architecture
- **Central Management Point**: Single location for global policy definition
- **Distribution Mechanism**: Automatic propagation to applicable domains
- **Version Control**: Centralized tracking of global policy changes
- **Assignment Management**: Controlled application of global policies to domains

## Connection Potential
- Links to Domain Management Server policy enforcement
- Connects to Cross-Domain Management coordination
- Relates to Global Assignment deployment patterns
- Associates with Policy Layer architecture concepts
