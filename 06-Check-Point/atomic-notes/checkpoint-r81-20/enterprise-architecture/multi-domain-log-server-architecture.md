# Multi-Domain Log Server Architecture Pattern

## Core Concept
Multi-Domain Log Server serves as a dedicated container for Domain Log Servers, providing centralized log management for Multi-Domain Security Management environments with automated log processing and storage.

## Log Server Hierarchy
- **Multi-Domain Log Server**: Physical container hosting multiple Domain Log Servers
- **Domain Log Servers**: Virtual log servers dedicated to specific domains
- **Domain Isolation**: Separate log storage and processing for each domain
- **Centralized Management**: Single physical infrastructure managing distributed logging

## Log Management Functions
- **Automatic File Management**: New log files created when size limits exceeded
- **Backup and Restoration**: Automated log file backup and recovery capabilities
- **Import/Export Operations**: Log file transfer and archival functionality
- **Index Management**: Automated indexing for faster log query performance

## Enterprise Logging Benefits
- **High Volume Processing**: Optimized for large-scale Multi-Domain Security Management environments
- **Domain Separation**: Isolated log processing prevents cross-domain data exposure
- **Performance Optimization**: Dedicated logging infrastructure reduces management server load
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support for multiple domains with independent log processing

## Integration Architecture
- **SmartConsole Integration**: Direct log access through SmartConsole interface
- **Domain-Specific Views**: Log filtering by Security Gateways, Domain Management Servers, or Domain Log Servers
- **Multi-Domain Overview**: Unified log view across all domains from Multi-Domain Server SmartConsole
- **SmartView Web Application**: Browser-based log access through dedicated web interface

## Operational Characteristics
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Domain Log Servers synchronize automatically across infrastructure
- **SIC Trust Integration**: Secure Internal Communication for authenticated log transmission
- **License Management**: Individual licensing for Multi-Domain Log Server and Domain Log Servers
- **Policy Installation**: Database installation on Log Servers for operational readiness

## Performance Features
- **Dedicated Infrastructure**: Separate hardware for log processing reduces management server load
- **High Volume Support**: Optimized for environments generating large volumes of security logs
- **Query Optimization**: Indexed logs provide fast search and retrieval capabilities
- **Resource Isolation**: Log processing isolated from management operations

## Connection Potential
- Links to Domain Log Server configuration
- Connects to Security Gateway log forwarding
- Relates to SmartConsole log viewing capabilities
- Associates with High Availability synchronization patterns
