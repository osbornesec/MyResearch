# Domain Management Server Virtual Architecture

## Core Concept
A Domain Management Server is the functional equivalent of a Security Management Server in a single-domain environment, operating as a virtual server within a Multi-Domain Server infrastructure.

## Virtual Management Components
- **Domain Security Gateways**: Managed security infrastructure for specific domains
- **Domain Security Policies**: Rules and configurations specific to domain requirements
- **Domain Objects**: Services, users, VPN Communities, and other domain-level entities
- **Domain Software Blades**: Security features and their related configurations

## Enterprise Virtualization Benefits
- **Resource Isolation**: Each domain operates independently within shared infrastructure
- **Management Separation**: Domain-specific administration without cross-domain interference
- **Scalable Deployment**: Multiple virtual management servers on single physical platform
- **High Availability Integration**: Active/Standby configurations across multiple physical servers

## Multi-Tenancy Architecture
- **Entity-Based Domains**: Support for company, business unit, department, or geographical domains
- **Customer Isolation**: Cloud service provider model with one domain per customer
- **Geographic Distribution**: Regional, state, or country-based domain segmentation

## Connection Potential
- Links to Multi-Domain Server physical architecture
- Connects to Domain definition and boundaries
- Relates to SmartConsole domain management interfaces
- Associates with High Availability deployment patterns
