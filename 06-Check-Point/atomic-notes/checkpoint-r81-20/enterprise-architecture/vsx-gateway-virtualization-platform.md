# VSX Gateway Virtualization Platform

## Core Concept
A VSX Gateway is a physical machine that hosts virtual networks of Virtual Devices, providing the functionality of their physical network counterparts such as Security Gateways, routers and switches.

## Key Responsibilities
- Communicates with the Management Server to deploy, configure, and manage all Virtual Devices
- Manages state synchronization for High Availability and for Load Sharing in cluster deployments
- Hosts multiple concurrent Virtual Systems that function independently

## Research Context
Foundation concept for Check Point's Virtual System eXtension (VSX) technology that enables multiple virtual firewalls to run on the same hardware platform.

## Source Quality
