# VSX Data Center Hosting Model

## Core Concept
Data center providers utilize VSX to supply external hosting services for multiple domain servers and databases through shared physical infrastructure while maintaining security isolation using one Virtual System per domain.

## Shared Infrastructure Benefits
- Multiple domain networks share common physical infrastructure
- Backbone connectivity between each domain and data center
- Specialized services per domain (web hosting, mail servers, database servers)
- Cost-effective resource utilization across tenants

## Security Isolation
Each domain receives dedicated Virtual System ensuring complete isolation of:
- Security policies and enforcement
- Network traffic and routing
- Administrative access and control
- Audit trails and logging

## Service Delivery Model
Data center provider deploys single VSX Gateway serving multiple domains through virtualization, eliminating need for separate physical security appliances per tenant.

## Research Context
Multi-tenant hosting architecture that enables secure, isolated services delivery while maximizing infrastructure efficiency and reducing operational complexity.
