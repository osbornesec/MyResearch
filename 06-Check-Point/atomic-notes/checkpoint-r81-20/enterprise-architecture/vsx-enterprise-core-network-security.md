# VSX Enterprise Core Network Security

## Core Concept
VSX provides core network security by positioning adjacent to core network backbone switches, protecting internal networks through Layer 2, Layer 3, or combined security enforcement while communicating with existing infrastructure.

## Bridge Mode Benefits
Virtual Systems in Bridge Mode enable departmental network protection while preventing network segmentation. Switches positioned at department network entrances maintain connectivity while enforcing security policies.

## Security Implementation
- Security configured on per-VLAN basis for granular control
- Ensures connectivity between core network and Internet/external networks
- Provides perimeter security while maintaining internal network access
- Integrates with existing core network infrastructure

## Enterprise Characteristics
Suitable for large enterprise environments with diverse networks across multiple locations requiring centralized security management and throughput maintenance.

## Research Context
Enterprise deployment pattern that leverages existing network infrastructure while adding comprehensive security capabilities without disrupting network topology.
