# Virtual System Load Sharing VSLS

## Core Concept
Virtual System Load Sharing (VSLS) enhances throughput by distributing Virtual Systems with their traffic load among multiple redundant machines while providing failover for individual Virtual Systems.

## Performance Benefits
- Significant performance advantages for CPU-intensive applications (VPNs, Security Servers, Policy Servers, Active Directory/LDAP)
- Efficient performance load distribution among VSX Cluster Members
- Standby and Backup Virtual System instances distributed to maximize throughput even during failover

## Scalability Architecture
- Excellent scalability solution allowing addition of VSX Cluster Members to existing VSLS cluster
- Accommodates increasing traffic loads and performance requirements
- Active Virtual System instances run on different VSX Cluster Members for optimal load distribution

## Research Context
Load balancing architecture that enables horizontal scaling of Virtual Systems across multiple physical platforms for enhanced performance.
