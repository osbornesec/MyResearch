# Multi-Domain Permission Profile Architecture

## Core Concept
Permission profiles provide predefined sets of permissions for administrators in Multi-Domain Security Management environments, enabling granular access control and administrative responsibility management across complex enterprise deployments.

## Permission Profile Hierarchy
- **Multi-Domain Permission Profiles**: Define administrator permissions for the entire Multi-Domain Security Management environment
- **Domain Permission Profiles**: Define permission sets per individual domain
- **Role-Based Segmentation**: Permissions aligned with organizational responsibilities and security requirements
- **Granular Control**: Fine-grained access control for different elements of the environment

## Predefined Multi-Domain Permission Levels
- **Multi-Domain Superuser**: Complete management authority over all Multi-Domain components, servers, domains, policies, and administrators
- **Domain Superuser**: Full domain management without Multi-Domain Server or Log Server modification rights
- **Global Manager**: Global domain and policy management with limited domain administrative rights
- **Domain Manager**: Domain-specific policy and object management with restricted global policy creation
- **Domain Level Only**: Domain policy management without Multi-Domain system access

## Enterprise Authorization Architecture
- **Administrative Separation**: Clear boundaries between different levels of administrative responsibility
- **Delegation Model**: Higher-level administrators can manage equal or lower permission administrators
- **Security Isolation**: Domain Level Only administrators cannot access Multi-Domain Server management
- **Global Policy Control**: Restricted global assignment creation prevents unauthorized enterprise policy changes

## Authentication Integration
- **Multiple Authentication Methods**: Support for various authentication mechanisms per organizational requirements
- **Certificate-Based Authentication**: PKCS#12 certificate files with optional password protection
- **CAPI Integration**: Microsoft Windows CryptoAPI certificate repository support
- **Account Expiration**: Configurable administrator account expiration for security compliance

## Operational Benefits
- **Scalable Administration**: Support for large numbers of administrators with complex permission requirements
- **Compliance Alignment**: Role-based access control supports regulatory compliance requirements
- **Security Boundaries**: Clear separation between different levels of system access
- **Administrative Efficiency**: Predefined profiles reduce complexity in permission management

## Connection Potential
- Links to Domain Management Server access control
- Connects to Global Domain policy management
- Relates to Multi-Domain Server administrative boundaries
- Associates with certificate authority and authentication systems
