# Virtual System Security Domain

## Core Concept
A Virtual System is a virtual security and routing domain that provides the functionality of a Security Gateway with full Firewall and VPN facilities. Multiple Virtual Systems can run concurrently on a single VSX Gateway, each functioning independently.

## Independent Components
Each Virtual System maintains its own:
- Software Blades, interfaces, IP addresses, routing table, ARP table
- State Tables with configuration and runtime data
- Security and VPN policies (including INSPECT code)
- Configuration parameters (IPS settings, TCP/UDP time-outs)
- Logging configuration and rules

## Research Context
Core virtualization component that enables network segmentation and independent security policy enforcement within a single physical platform.
