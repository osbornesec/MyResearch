## Key Architectural Principles
1. **Virtual Device Independence**: Each Virtual System maintains complete isolation
2. **Context Determination**: VRF technology enables overlapping IP spaces
3. **Centralized Management**: Single point of control for multiple virtual environments
4. **Performance Scaling**: VSLS enables horizontal performance scaling
5. **Topology Preservation**: Bridge Mode maintains existing network structures
