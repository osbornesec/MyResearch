# VSX Managed Service Provider Architecture

## Core Concept
VSX enables managed service providers to deliver connectivity and security services for multiple Domain networks through centralized hardware consolidation while ensuring privacy and secure VPN connectivity in Point of Presence (POP) deployments.

## Multi-Domain Integration
- VSX and Multi-Domain Server provide centralized, granular provisioning for multiple domains
- Applications and services separated by discrete Virtual Systems
- Access control based on specific domain requirements
- Privacy maintained through isolated Virtual System environments

## Service Provider Benefits
- Hardware consolidation reduces infrastructure costs
- Centralized management simplifies operations
- Maintains existing IP topology without disruption
- Supports both High Availability and Virtual System Load Sharing cluster modes

## Log Management
Multi-Domain Log Server collects data for each domain and stores logs in separate private databases, ensuring audit trail isolation and compliance.

## Research Context
Service provider deployment model that enables multi-tenant security services while maintaining strict domain isolation and centralized management capabilities.
