# Cross-Domain Management Coordination Pattern

## Core Concept
Cross-Domain Management enables administrators to manage security policies, objects, and configurations spanning multiple domains from centralized interfaces while maintaining domain isolation and security boundaries.

## Coordination Architecture
- **Unified Management Interface**: SmartConsole Multi-Domain view providing centralized access to all domains
- **Gateways & Servers View**: Enterprise-wide visibility of Security Gateways, Domain Management Servers, and Domain Log Servers
- **Domain Switching**: Direct connection capabilities from Multi-Domain view to specific Domain Management Servers
- **Cross-Domain Search**: Search functionality spanning multiple domains with permission-based filtering

## Administrative Coordination
- **Multi-Domain Permission Integration**: Permission profiles enabling cross-domain administrative access
- **Global Assignment Management**: Central coordination of global policy assignment to multiple domains
- **Session Management**: Coordinated session handling across multiple Domain Management Servers
- **Configuration Synchronization**: Automated coordination of configuration changes across domain boundaries

## Security Boundary Management
- **Domain Isolation**: Maintained security boundaries despite cross-domain management capabilities
- **Permission-Based Access**: Cross-domain visibility limited by administrator permission profiles
- **Audit Trail Coordination**: Comprehensive logging across domain boundaries for compliance tracking
- **Certificate Trust Management**: Coordinated certificate authority relationships across domains

## Operational Benefits
- **Administrative Efficiency**: Single interface for managing complex multi-domain environments
- **Consistency Enforcement**: Coordinated policy application ensuring enterprise-wide security standards
- **Resource Optimization**: Centralized management reducing administrative overhead and complexity
- **Visibility Enhancement**: Complete enterprise security posture visibility from single management point

## Enterprise Integration Features
- **Global Object Sharing**: Coordinated sharing of network objects and configuration settings across domains
- **Policy Coordination**: Global policy development with coordinated local domain application
- **Monitoring Integration**: Unified monitoring and alerting across multiple domain boundaries
- **Reporting Consolidation**: Enterprise-wide reporting capabilities spanning all managed domains

## Connection Potential
- Links to Multi-Domain Permission Profile architecture
- Connects to Global Domain policy management
- Relates to SmartConsole unified interface design
- Associates with Global Assignment deployment patterns
