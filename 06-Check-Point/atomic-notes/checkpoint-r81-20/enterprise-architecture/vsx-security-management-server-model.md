# VSX Security Management Server Model

## Core Concept
The Security Management Server model is designed for enterprise deployments with many Virtual Systems but single domain management. SmartConsole connects to the VSX Gateway and directly manages each Virtual System.

## Deployment Characteristics
- Single management domain for all Virtual Systems
- Direct management of Virtual Systems through SmartConsole
- Suitable for enterprise environments with unified administration
- Supports physical Security Gateway and VSX Gateway management together

## Capacity Limitations
- 1 Management Domain
- 1 Concurrent Administrator
- 1 Object Database
- 250 Policies
- 25 Virtual Systems (recommended)

## Research Context
Centralized management approach for enterprise VSX deployments requiring unified administrative control across multiple Virtual Systems.
