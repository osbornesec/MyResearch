# Virtual Router Routing Domain

## Core Concept
A Virtual Router is an independent routing domain within a VSX Gateway that performs the functionality of physical routers. Virtual Routers are useful for connecting multiple Virtual Systems to a shared interface and for routing traffic between Virtual Systems.

## Routing Functions
- Direct packets arriving through shared interfaces to designated Virtual Systems based on source/destination IP address
- Route traffic from Virtual Systems to shared interfaces or other Virtual Systems
- Manage traffic to and from shared network resources such as DMZ
- Support dynamic routing protocols

## Security Characteristics
Virtual Routers inspect all traffic destined to or emanating from themselves based on security policy. Traffic not sent to or coming from the Virtual Router is forwarded without inspection.

## Research Context
Essential component for inter-Virtual System connectivity and shared resource access in VSX deployments.
