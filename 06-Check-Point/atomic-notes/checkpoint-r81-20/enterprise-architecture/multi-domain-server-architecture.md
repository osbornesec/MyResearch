# Multi-Domain Server Architecture Pattern

## Core Concept
A Multi-Domain Server (MDS) is a physical server that contains virtual Domain Management Servers, providing centralized management for large-scale, distributed environments with discrete network segments.

## Architectural Components
- **Physical Infrastructure**: Dedicated server hardware hosting virtual management infrastructure
- **Domain Management Servers**: Virtual equivalents of Security Management Servers
- **Security Policies**: Domain-specific and global security configurations
- **System Data**: Configuration settings, objects, and operational data
- **Multi-Domain Software**: Centralized management system software

## Enterprise Design Patterns
- **Virtualization Layer**: Multiple Domain Management Servers on single physical infrastructure
- **Centralized Control**: Single point of management for distributed domains
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support for multiple domains with different security requirements
- **High Availability Support**: Capable of synchronized deployment across multiple servers

## Connection Potential
- Links to Domain Management Server architecture
- Connects to High Availability deployment patterns
- Relates to Enterprise Security Gateway management
- Associates with Global Domain management concepts
