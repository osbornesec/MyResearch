# VSX Context Determination VRF

## Core Concept
VSX incorporates VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding) technology that allows creation of multiple, independent routing domains on a single VSX Gateway or VSX Cluster. Each routing domain is known as a context, enabling Virtual Devices with overlapping IP addresses.

## Context Determination Process
When traffic arrives at VSX Gateway, Context Determination directs traffic to appropriate Virtual System, Virtual Router, or Virtual Switch based on virtual network topology and Virtual Device connectivity.

## Connection Scenarios
- Virtual System directly connected to physical or VLAN interface
- Virtual System connected through Virtual Switch (MAC-based forwarding)
- Virtual System connected through Virtual Router (IP-based routing)

## Independence Characteristics
The independence of routing domains enables overlapping IP address spaces across different Virtual Systems without conflicts.

## Research Context
Foundation technology that enables traffic isolation and routing independence across multiple virtual environments on single physical platform.
