# VSX Bridge Mode Layer2 Security

## Core Concept
Bridge Mode implements native Layer 2 bridging instead of IP routing, enabling addition of Virtual Systems without affecting existing IP structure. Virtual System interfaces do not require IP addresses in Bridge Mode.

## Bridge Mode Models
- **Active/Active Bridge Mode**: Provides redundancy while preventing loops between redundant switches using Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
- **Active/Standby Bridge Mode**: Provides path redundancy, loop prevention, seamless VSLS support, and overcomes STP limitations

## Technical Advantages
- Instantaneous failover in Active/Standby mode
- Enhanced administrator control over bridge failover
- VLAN translation capabilities
- Optional Layer 3 monitoring through Virtual System IP assignment

## Deployment Benefits
- Prevents network segmentation while providing security
- Maintains existing network infrastructure
- Enables departmental network protection without IP restructuring
- Supports high-traffic enterprise environments through three-layer hierarchical model

## Research Context
Layer 2 security enforcement mechanism that preserves existing network topology while adding comprehensive security capabilities through transparent bridging.
