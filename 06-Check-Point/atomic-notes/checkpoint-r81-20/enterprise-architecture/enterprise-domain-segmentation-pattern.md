# Enterprise Domain Segmentation Pattern

## Core Concept
A Domain is a virtual object that defines a network or collection of networks related to an entity, enabling enterprise-scale segmentation based on geography, business units, or security functions.

## Segmentation Strategies
- **Geographic Segmentation**: Domains per geographical region, state, or country
- **Business Unit Segmentation**: Domains aligned with organizational structure
- **Functional Segmentation**: Domains based on security requirements or operational functions
- **Customer Segmentation**: Multi-tenant environments with domain per customer

## Enterprise Use Cases
- **Cloud Service Providers**: One domain per customer for complete isolation
- **Financial Institutions**: Geographic regions for regulatory compliance
- **Multinational Corporations**: Country or regional business units
- **Government Organizations**: Department or agency-based segmentation

## Security Benefits
- **Isolation Boundaries**: Network segments with different security requirements
- **Policy Separation**: Domain-specific security policies without interference
- **Administrative Boundaries**: Separated management responsibilities
- **Compliance Alignment**: Regulatory requirements per geographic or business domain

## Architectural Implications
- **Virtual Network Definition**: Logical grouping of physical network segments
- **Entity-Based Organization**: Alignment with business or operational entities
- **Scalable Management**: Support for large numbers of discrete domains
- **Cross-Domain Coordination**: Managed interaction between domain boundaries
