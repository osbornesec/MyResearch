# Unnumbered Interface IP Address Conservation

## Core Concept
VSX allows reduction of IP addresses required for network deployment by enabling Warp Links connected to Virtual Routers to "borrow" existing IP addresses from other interfaces instead of requiring dedicated addresses.

## Technical Implementation
- Warp Link connected to Virtual Router can borrow IP address from another interface
- Unnumbered interfaces act as next hop from Virtual Router
- Capability specifically designed for Virtual Router deployments

## Limitations
- Unnumbered interfaces must connect to Virtual Router
- Individual interface IP address can only be borrowed once
- For VPN or Hide NAT usage, borrowed address must be routable

## Research Context
IP address conservation mechanism that enables efficient resource utilization in large-scale VSX deployments.
