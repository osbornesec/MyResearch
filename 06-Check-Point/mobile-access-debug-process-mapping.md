# Mobile Access Debug Process Mapping

## Core Concept
Mobile Access debugging requires targeting specific processes based on the functional area being investigated: httpd for portal traffic, cvpnd for authentication/authorization, and vpnd for SNX/SSL termination.

## Process Responsibility Matrix

### HTTPD Process
- **Portal Traffic**: Login and portal-related communications
- **Web Traffic**: General web application access
- **Link Translation**: URL conversion and rewriting
- **DNS Operations**: Domain name resolution functions
- **SSO Partial**: Some single sign-on functionality
- **Web Intelligence**: Web-based threat detection
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery prevention

### CVPND Process
- **Configuration**: Policy configuration from management server
- **Authentication**: User identity verification
- **Authorization**: Access control and permissions
- **Session Management**: User session lifecycle
- **Cluster Synchronization**: High availability coordination
- **Kernel Tables**: Mobile Access kernel table management
- **SSO Partial**: Additional single sign-on components

### VPND Process + VPN Kernel Module
- **SNX Operations**: SSL Network Extender functionality
- **SSL Termination**: SSL connection handling and termination
- **Client Certificate Verification**: PKI-based authentication

## Debug Strategy Selection
Debug process selection should align with symptom categories to maximize diagnostic efficiency and minimize impact on production systems.

## Connection Potential
- Links to: Process architecture, debugging methodologies, troubleshooting frameworks
- Builds on: Check Point gateway process architecture and modular security functions
- Integrates with: System monitoring and performance analysis practices
