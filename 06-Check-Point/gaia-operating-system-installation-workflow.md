# Gaia Operating System Installation Workflow

## Core Concept
Gaia OS installation follows structured deployment scenarios supporting Check Point appliances and open servers with configurable disk partitioning, first-time configuration wizards, and unattended installation capabilities.

## Installation Methods
- **Check Point Appliances**: Direct installation with hardware-optimized configurations
- **Open Servers**: Generic hardware installation with manual hardware configuration
- **Blink Image**: Pre-configured gateway appliance rapid deployment
- **Unattended USB**: Automated installation using pre-configured parameters
- **Disk Partition Customization**: Adjustable partition sizes during and after installation

## Configuration Workflow
1. **Initial Installation**: Deploy Gaia OS using appropriate method for hardware type
2. **First Time Configuration**: Complete network and basic system setup via Portal or CLI
3. **Management Interface**: Configure IP addressing for administrative access
4. **IPv6 Enablement**: Optional IPv6 protocol stack activation
5. **Post-Installation Tuning**: Disk partition adjustments and system optimization

## Deployment Scenarios
- **Security Management Server**: Centralized policy and log management
- **Security Gateway**: Network traffic inspection and enforcement
- **Multi-Domain Server**: Enterprise multi-tenant management architecture
- **Dedicated Log Server**: Centralized logging and event correlation
- **High Availability**: Primary and secondary server configurations
