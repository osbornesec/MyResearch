# SmartEvent Correlation and Analysis

## Core Concept
SmartEvent provides advanced security event correlation, analysis, and reporting capabilities through dedicated correlation engines that process logs from Security Gateways, external sources, and multi-domain environments for comprehensive threat detection.

## Architecture Components
- **Correlation Unit**: Advanced event processing engine for pattern recognition and threat analysis
- **SmartEvent Server**: Dedicated server for high-volume log processing and correlation
- **External Log Integration**: Syslog parser generation for third-party system integration
- **LEA Integration**: Log Export API connectivity for real-time event processing
- **Multi-Domain Support**: Tenant-isolated correlation with centralized management

## Correlation Capabilities
- **Event Pattern Recognition**: Identify complex attack patterns across multiple log sources
- **Threat Intelligence**: Correlate events with known threat indicators and attack signatures
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Detect anomalous activities and deviation from baseline behavior
- **Cross-System Correlation**: Integrate events from multiple security systems and domains
- **Real-Time Processing**: Live event analysis with immediate alerting and notification

## Deployment Models
- **Integrated Deployment**: SmartEvent enabled on Security Management Server
- **Dedicated Server**: Standalone SmartEvent server for enterprise environments
- **Multi-Domain Integration**: Connection to Multi-Domain Server with domain isolation
- **High Availability**: Primary and secondary SmartEvent server configurations
- **External Connectivity**: Integration with SIEM and external security management platforms

## Administrative Operations
- **License Management**: SmartEvent licensing and feature enablement
- **Log Source Configuration**: Setup log collection from internal and external sources
- **Correlation Rule Management**: Custom correlation rules and policy configuration
- **Report Generation**: Automated and on-demand security reports and dashboards
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimization for high-volume log processing environments
