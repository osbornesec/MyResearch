# LDAP Search Validation Procedure

## Core Concept
LDAP search validation uses ldapsearch command to verify user configuration accuracy including Full Distinguished Name correctness and credential authentication.

## Command Syntax
```bash
ldapsearch -h Domain_Controller_IP -D "Full_DN_for_User" -w "Password" -b "Base_DN" "LDAP_Search_Filter"
```

## Example Implementation
```bash
ldapsearch -h 10.20.30.40 -D "CN=Administrator, CN=Users, DC=Support, DC=checkpoint, DC=com" -b "DC=support, DC=checkpoint, DC=com" -w "my_password" "(&(objectclass=user)(sAMAccountName=Administrator))" > /var/tmp/ldap_test.txt
```

## Result Analysis
- **Error output**: Incorrect command syntax, username, or password
- **0 matches**: User not located under specified LDAP_Search_Filter
- **Successful output**: User identified with details in output file

## Validation Points
- Full Distinguished Name accuracy
- Password authentication success
- Base DN search scope correctness
- LDAP filter matching effectiveness

## Research Context
Essential validation step for LDAP connectivity before advanced debugging procedures.

## Connection Potential
- Links to Active Directory structure understanding
- Connects to LDAP protocol troubleshooting
- Related to distinguished name configuration patterns
