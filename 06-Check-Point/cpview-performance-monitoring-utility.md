# CPView Performance Monitoring Utility

## Core Concept
CPView provides real-time system performance monitoring and analysis for Check Point security appliances, offering comprehensive visibility into resource utilization, traffic patterns, and system health metrics.

## Monitoring Capabilities
- **System Resources**: CPU utilization, memory consumption, disk I/O, and network interface statistics
- **Traffic Analysis**: Throughput, connection counts, packet rates, and protocol distribution
- **Security Performance**: Firewall processing rates, VPN tunnel statistics, and threat prevention metrics
- **Hardware Monitoring**: Temperature sensors, fan speeds, power consumption, and component health
- **Historical Trending**: Time-based performance graphs and comparative analysis

## User Interface Features
- **Real-Time Display**: Live updating dashboards with configurable refresh intervals
- **Graphical Visualization**: Charts, graphs, and meters for intuitive performance analysis
- **Threshold Alerting**: Configurable warning and critical thresholds with visual indicators
- **Data Export**: Performance data export for external analysis and reporting
- **Zoom and Navigation**: Time-range selection and detailed drill-down capabilities

## Performance Optimization
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Pinpoint system constraints and performance limitations
- **Baseline Establishment**: Capture normal operating parameters for comparison analysis
- **Capacity Planning**: Resource utilization trends for infrastructure planning
- **Troubleshooting Support**: Performance correlation with security events and errors
- **Tuning Validation**: Measure impact of configuration changes and optimizations
