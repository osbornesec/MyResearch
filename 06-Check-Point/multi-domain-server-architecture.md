# Multi-Domain Server Architecture

## Core Concept
Multi-Domain Server (MDS) provides enterprise-scale security management architecture enabling centralized administration of multiple independent security domains with tenant isolation, distributed policy management, and scalable logging infrastructure.

## Architectural Components
- **Global Domain**: Centralized management interface for cross-domain administration
- **Customer Domains**: Isolated security policy domains with independent administration
- **Domain Management Servers**: Per-domain policy and configuration management
- **Multi-Domain Log Server**: Centralized logging with domain-specific data isolation
- **High Availability**: Primary and secondary MDS configurations for business continuity

## Management Capabilities
- **Domain Isolation**: Complete tenant separation with independent policies and administrators
- **Centralized Licensing**: Global license pool management with per-domain allocation
- **Cross-Domain Reporting**: Aggregate security reporting with domain-specific drill-down
- **Administrator Delegation**: Domain-specific administrative permissions and access control
- **Policy Distribution**: Centralized policy deployment with domain-specific customization

## Operational Workflows
- **Domain Creation**: Establish new customer domains with isolated management contexts
- **Context Switching**: Use `mdsenv` command for domain-specific administrative operations
- **Service Management**: Domain-specific service control with `mdsstart_customer` and `mdsstop_customer`
- **Configuration Management**: Domain-isolated configuration with global oversight capabilities
- **Migration Support**: Move domains between MDS installations with data preservation

## Scalability Features
- **Distributed Management**: Load distribution across multiple Domain Management Servers
- **Resource Allocation**: Per-domain resource limits and capacity management
- **Performance Optimization**: Domain-specific tuning and optimization capabilities
- **Growth Management**: Dynamic domain addition without service disruption
- **Geographic Distribution**: Multi-site MDS deployment for global enterprises
