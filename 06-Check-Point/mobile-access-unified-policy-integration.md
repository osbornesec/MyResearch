# Mobile Access Unified Policy Integration

## Core Concept
Mobile Access Blade supports both Legacy Policy and Unified Policy frameworks since R80.10, with default Legacy Policy and optional migration to Unified Policy requiring policy installation.

## Policy Framework Options
- **Legacy Policy**: Default configuration compatible with R77.30 and below
- **Unified Policy**: Advanced framework available since R80.10
- **Migration Path**: Administrator-controlled switch requiring policy installation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained support for existing configurations

## Unified Policy Capabilities
- **Access Control Policy Integration**: All Mobile Access rules configured in unified rule base
- **Gateway Scope Control**: Rules can apply to all or specific Mobile Access gateways
- **Client-Specific Rules**: Granular control for Mobile Access portal and Capsule Workspace
- **Feature Preservation**: Protection Levels, Secure Workspace, and Endpoint Compliance maintained

## Configuration Hybrid Model
- **Unified Access Policy**: Primary rule configuration location
- **SmartDashboard Mobile Access Tab**: Continued configuration for specific features and settings
- **Policy Install Requirement**: Changes require policy installation for activation

## Connection Potential
- Links to: Check Point policy management framework, access control architecture
- Builds on: Unified security policy concepts and rule base management
- Integrates with: Check Point R80+ management architecture evolution
