# Check Point Logging Architecture

## Core Concept
Check Point logging architecture provides centralized log collection, storage, and analysis through Security Management Servers, dedicated Log Servers, and SmartEvent correlation engines with configurable retention policies and indexing capabilities.

## Logging Components
- **Security Management Server**: Integrated logging for single-domain environments
- **Dedicated Log Server**: Standalone log collection and storage optimization
- **Domain Dedicated Log Server**: Multi-Domain logging with tenant isolation
- **SmartEvent Server**: Advanced correlation, analysis, and event generation
- **Dynamic Log Distribution**: Intelligent load balancing across logging infrastructure

## Storage Management
- **Log Retention Policies**: Configurable daily log retention periods with automatic aging
- **Storage Optimization**: Compression, indexing, and archival for long-term storage
- **Migration Management**: Automated log transfer during system upgrades
- **Index Management**: Enable/disable indexing for search performance optimization
- **Receive Rate Monitoring**: Track log ingestion rates and performance metrics

## Advanced Features
- **LEA (Log Export API)**: Programmatic log access for external systems integration
- **Syslog Integration**: Import external syslog messages with parser generation
- **Offline Log Analysis**: Import and analyze historical log files
- **External Log Reading**: SmartEvent integration with third-party log sources
- **Multi-Domain Isolation**: Tenant-specific logging with administrative separation
