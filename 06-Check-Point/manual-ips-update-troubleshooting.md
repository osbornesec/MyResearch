# Manual IPS Update Troubleshooting

## Core Concept
Manual IPS update troubleshooting focuses on client PC connectivity to Check Point update servers, requiring browser verification, proxy configuration, and SmartConsole debugging.

## Required Server Connectivity
Client must reach these URLs via DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS:
- http://cws.checkpoint.com
- https://updates.checkpoint.com
- http://dl3.checkpoint.com
- https://secureupdates.checkpoint.com

## Connectivity Verification Method
- **Browser test**: Open URLs in web browser (Chrome, IE)
- **Expected responses**: Redirect, "It works!", "File not found"
- **Problem indicator**: Blank page indicates connectivity issue

## Common Issues and Solutions
- **99% stuck**: Refer to sk111760 for specific resolution
- **HTTPS Inspection**: Enable bypass for software update services (sk98655)
- **Update won't start**: Collect SmartConsole debug (sk112334) and Wireshark capture

## Debug Collection Requirements
- SmartConsole GUI client debugging
- Wireshark traffic capture during issue replication
- Coordinate debug timing with update failure

## Research Context
Client-side troubleshooting methodology for manual IPS update failures.

## Connection Potential
- Links to network connectivity troubleshooting patterns
- Connects to proxy configuration and HTTPS inspection
