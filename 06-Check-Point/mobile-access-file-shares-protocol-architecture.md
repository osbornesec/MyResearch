# Mobile Access File Shares Protocol Architecture

## Core Concept
Mobile Access file shares enable network-based file collection access through protocols like SMB for Windows, providing file operations (open, read, write, delete) across the network.

## Protocol Support
- **Primary Protocol**: SMB (Server Message Block) for Windows environments
- **Cross-Network Operations**: File actions performed across network boundaries
- **Standard File Operations**: Open, read, write, and delete functionality

## Technical Architecture
- **Network File Collection**: Files made available across network infrastructure
- **Protocol Abstraction**: Mobile Access mediates between client and file server protocols
- **Remote File Access**: Network-based file system access without local storage

## Integration with Mobile Access
- **Browser-Based Access**: File shares accessible through web interface
- **CIFS Mount Functionality**: Windows file share integration
- **Clientless Operation**: No additional file client software required

## Security Features
- **Protocol Security**: Secure file transfer through Mobile Access gateway
- **Access Control**: User-based file share authorization
- **Encrypted Transport**: File operations encrypted through SSL/TLS

## Connection Potential
- Links to: Network file systems, SMB/CIFS protocols, file server security
- Builds on: Network file sharing architectures and remote access technologies
- Integrates with: Mobile Access authentication and authorization framework
