# fwaccel Command Suite Acceleration Management

## Core Concept
The `fwaccel` command suite provides comprehensive SecureXL acceleration management, including configuration control, connection monitoring, debug capabilities, and DoS protection administration for optimized firewall performance.

## Command Categories
- **Configuration Management**: `fwaccel cfg` for acceleration feature configuration and mode selection
- **Connection Analysis**: `fwaccel conns` for real-time connection template inspection and statistics
- **Debug Operations**: `fwaccel dbg` for detailed packet flow analysis and troubleshooting
- **DoS Protection**: `fwaccel dos` suite for rate limiting, attack mitigation, and protection configuration
- **Statistics Collection**: Performance metrics, acceleration ratios, and traffic analysis

## DoS Mitigation Commands
- **Rate Configuration**: `fwaccel dos rate` for setting traffic rate limits and thresholds
- **Allow/Deny Lists**: `fwaccel dos allow/deny` for whitelist and blacklist management
- **Protection Box**: `fwaccel dos pbox` for advanced DoS protection configuration
- **Statistics Monitoring**: `fwaccel dos stats` for attack detection and mitigation effectiveness
- **Policy Configuration**: `fwaccel dos config` for global DoS protection settings

## Acceleration Analysis
- **Template Inspection**: View connection templates, acceleration decisions, and bypass logic
- **Traffic Classification**: Identify accelerated vs non-accelerated traffic patterns
- **Performance Metrics**: Acceleration ratios, throughput improvements, and resource utilization
- **Debug Tracing**: Packet-level analysis for acceleration troubleshooting
- **Configuration Validation**: Verify acceleration settings and feature enablement

## Operational Use Cases
- Performance optimization through acceleration tuning and configuration
- DoS attack mitigation with real-time rate limiting and traffic control
- Troubleshooting acceleration issues and connection template problems
- Capacity planning using acceleration statistics and performance metrics
