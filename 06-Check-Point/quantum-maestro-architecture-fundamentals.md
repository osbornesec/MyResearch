# Quantum Maestro Architecture Fundamentals

## Core Concept

Scalable network security system architecture combining Maestro Hyperscale Orchestrator (MHO) with multiple Security Gateway Modules (SGMs) into unified Security Groups, providing enterprise-scale performance through distributed processing.

## Architectural Components

### Maestro Hyperscale Orchestrator (MHO)
- **Function**: Orchestration and distribution coordination for connected appliances
- **Scale Limits**: Supports maximum 8 Security Groups per MHO system
- **Hardware Models**: MHO-140, MHO-170, MHO-175 with varying port densities
- **Redundancy**: Dual orchestrator clustering for high availability

### Security Gateway Module (SGM)
- **Definition**: Individual Check Point appliances participating in Security Group
- **Scale Limits**: 14 SGMs per site (single-site) or 28 total (dual-site: 14 per site)
- **Shared Attributes**: Security policy, configuration, software versions, routing information
- **Traffic Distribution**: Load sharing according to Security Group distribution mode settings

### Single Management Object (SMO)
- **Purpose**: Single SmartConsole object representing entire Security Group
- **Management Simplification**: Unified policy and configuration management
- **Licensing Model**: 1 Security Group = 1 Gateway license
- **Hardware Type**: Appears as "Maestro" in SmartConsole

## Synchronization Architecture

### HyperSync Technology
- **Purpose**: High-scale synchronization without performance degradation
- **Scale Support**: Handles up to 52 appliances without sacrificing gateway performance
- **Overhead Minimization**: Specialized synchronization solution for enterprise deployments

### Throughput Characteristics
- **Performance Degradation**: 1% per added SGM (10% total for 10 SGMs)
- **Optimization Target**: Check Point continues reducing degradation in future releases

## Connectivity Architecture

### Downlink Connectivity
- **Automatic Bonding**: Multiple cables automatically bond without configuration
- **Dual Orchestrator Requirement**: SGM requires downlink to each orchestrator for active state
- **Distance Support**: Up to 300m short range, 10km long range with appropriate transceivers
- **Cable Standards**: 1m and 3m DAC cables included, 5m/10m available via certification

### Uplink Connectivity
- **Bonding Support**: Interface bonding between MHO and upstream network
- **Shared Interfaces**: Bonded interfaces can be shared between Security Groups
- **LACP Considerations**: Shared LACP bonds reduce security group segregation
