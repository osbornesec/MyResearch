# SecureXL Acceleration Framework

## Core Concept
SecureXL provides hardware-accelerated packet processing through kernel-mode (KPPAK) and user-mode (UPPAK) acceleration, using connection templates and policy installation optimization to achieve scalable firewall performance.

## Acceleration Technologies
- **Kernel Mode (KPPAK)**: Direct kernel packet processing bypass for established connections
- **User Mode (UPPAK)**: User-space acceleration with full security inspection capabilities
- **Connection Templates**: Pre-computed forwarding decisions for connection state optimization
- **Policy Installation Acceleration**: Optimized rule compilation and deployment mechanisms
- **Accelerated Features**: Hardware-offloaded inspection for supported traffic types

## Performance Optimization
- **Packet Flow Optimization**: Bypass slow-path processing for accelerated traffic
- **Template Caching**: Store connection decisions for rapid packet forwarding
- **DoS Mitigation**: Rate limiting and SYN attack protection with hardware acceleration
- **Multi-Core Scaling**: CoreXL integration for parallel processing capabilities
- **Traffic Analysis**: Real-time monitoring of accelerated vs non-accelerated traffic flows

## Configuration Management
- **Mode Selection**: Dynamic switching between KPPAK and UPPAK based on requirements
- **Feature Enablement**: Selective acceleration for specific traffic types and protocols
- **Debug Capabilities**: Comprehensive logging and analysis tools for performance tuning
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable DoS protection with granular control parameters
