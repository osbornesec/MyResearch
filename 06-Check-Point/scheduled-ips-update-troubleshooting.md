# Scheduled IPS Update Troubleshooting

## Core Concept
Scheduled IPS update troubleshooting focuses on Security Management Server connectivity, requiring /etc/hosts verification, contract configuration, and server-side debugging.

## Critical Configuration Requirements
- **Clean /etc/hosts**: Remove manual entries for update servers (cws.checkpoint.com, secureupdates.checkpoint.com, updates.checkpoint.com, dl3.checkpoint.com)
- **Contract downloads**: Enable "Automatically download Contracts and other important data" checkbox
- **HTTPS Inspection**: Configure bypass for software update services

## Connectivity Testing Without Proxy
```bash
nslookup cws.checkpoint.com
curl_cli -v -1 --cacert $CPDIR/conf/ca-bundle.crt https://updates.checkpoint.com
curl_cli -v http://dl3.checkpoint.com
curl_cli -v http://cws.checkpoint.com
```

## Connectivity Testing With Proxy
```bash
curl_cli -v -1 --cacert $CPDIR/conf/ca-bundle.crt https://updates.checkpoint.com -x <proxyIP:proxyPORT>
curl_cli -v http://dl3.checkpoint.com -x <proxyIP:proxyPORT>
curl_cli -v http://cws.checkpoint.com -x <proxyIP:proxyPORT>
```

## Error Indicators
- "Could not resolve host": DNS resolution failure
- "fetch .crl failed": Certificate or connectivity issue
- Connection timeouts: Network or proxy configuration problems

## Advanced Debugging
- **FWM debug**: Use TDERROR_ALL_FWMAU=5 during scheduled update window
- **Timing coordination**: Ensure debug runs during actual update attempt

## Research Context
Server-side troubleshooting methodology for automated IPS update failures.

## Connection Potential
- Links to management server connectivity patterns
- Connects to proxy configuration and certificate management
- Related to scheduled task debugging and FWM analysis
