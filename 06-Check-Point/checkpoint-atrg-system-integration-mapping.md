    ↓ accelerates ↓
CoreXL (Multi-Core Processing)
    ↓ distributes ↓
VPN Core (IPSec/SSL Processing)
    ↓ secures ↓
Mobile Access Blade (Remote Access)
```

### Cluster Coordination Framework

```

## Integration Points and Dependencies

### Mobile Access + VPN Core Integration
- **SSL/IPSec Coexistence**: Mobile Access SSL VPN and VPN Core IPSec operate through shared kernel tables
- **Authentication Flow**: Mobile Access realm authentication integrates with VPN Core certificate management
- **Policy Coordination**: Unified Policy framework affects both Mobile Access rules and VPN Core site-to-site configurations
- **Performance Impact**: SecureXL acceleration applies to both Mobile Access traffic and VPN Core tunnel processing

### CoreXL + SecureXL Performance Optimization
- **CPU Affinity Coordination**: CoreXL affinity settings directly impact SecureXL acceleration performance
- **Template Processing**: SecureXL templates (Accept/Drop/NAT) benefit from CoreXL multi-core distribution
- **Instance Management**: CoreXL firewall instances coordinate with SecureXL acceleration paths
- **VSX Integration**: Both systems support Virtual System context isolation and resource allocation

### Kernel Table Cross-System Usage
- **VPN Core Tables**: Used by Mobile Access for SSL tunnel management
- **Connection State**: Shared between all acceleration systems for stateful inspection
- **Cluster Synchronization**: CoreXL, VPN Core, and SecureXL coordinate through synchronized kernel tables
- **Performance Monitoring**: All systems contribute to unified acceleration statistics

## Configuration Interdependencies

### Policy Framework Integration
- **Unified Policy Impact**: Affects Mobile Access rules, VPN Core communities, and acceleration templates
- **Rule Processing**: SecureXL template generation depends on policy rule configuration
- **Authentication Integration**: Mobile Access realms coordinate with VPN Core peer authentication
- **Layer Coordination**: Policy layers can disable acceleration features across multiple systems

### Resource Allocation Coordination
- **CPU Core Assignment**: CoreXL affinity impacts VPN Core processing and SecureXL acceleration
- **Memory Management**: Kernel tables shared across VPN Core, Mobile Access, and acceleration systems
- **Network Interface Binding**: CoreXL interface affinity affects VPN tunnel assignment and Mobile Access portal binding
- **License Coordination**: CoreXL core licensing impacts overall system acceleration capability

## Troubleshooting Integration Points

### Multi-System Diagnostic Flow
1. **Performance Issues**: Check SecureXL templates → CoreXL affinity → VPN Core kernel tables → Mobile Access authentication
2. **Connectivity Problems**: Verify Mobile Access portal → VPN Core IKE negotiation → CoreXL instance assignment → SecureXL acceleration status
3. **Cluster Issues**: Validate CoreXL synchronization → VPN Core IKE forwarding → kernel table coordination → acceleration distribution

### Cross-System Monitoring Requirements
- **CoreXL Statistics**: Monitor multi-core distribution efficiency
- **SecureXL Metrics**: Track acceleration template effectiveness
- **VPN Core Tables**: Verify SA establishment and kernel table health
- **Mobile Access Logs**: Validate authentication and portal accessibility

## Operational Best Practices

### Integrated Configuration Management
- **Sequential Implementation**: Configure CoreXL affinity before enabling SecureXL acceleration
- **Policy Coordination**: Implement Unified Policy changes with awareness of acceleration impact
- **Resource Planning**: Size CoreXL instances based on VPN Core and Mobile Access load requirements
- **Testing Methodology**: Validate performance across all integrated systems after configuration changes

### Maintenance Coordination
- **Upgrade Sequencing**: Coordinate ATRG component upgrades to maintain integration compatibility
- **Monitoring Integration**: Implement unified monitoring covering all acceleration and VPN systems
- **Troubleshooting Workflows**: Develop integrated diagnostic procedures covering multi-system interactions
- **Performance Optimization**: Regular review of CoreXL affinity, SecureXL templates, and VPN Core efficiency
