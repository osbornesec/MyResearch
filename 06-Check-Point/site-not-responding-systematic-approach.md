# Site Not Responding Systematic Troubleshooting Approach

## Core Concept
Site connectivity issues require systematic multi-scenario analysis combining packet capture, TCP handshake verification, SSL negotiation examination, and connection state tracking across different network configurations.

## Troubleshooting Prerequisites
- **Best Practice Guide**: Thoroughly review sk156153 debugging guidelines before tool usage
- **Systematic approach**: Follow structured scenario-based methodology
- **Tool coordination**: Proper debug tool selection and timing

## Connection Analysis Components
- **TCP handshake completion**: Verify three-way handshake success
- **SSL negotiation**: Examine client hello and server hello exchange
- **Connection termination**: Analyze FYN-ACK patterns and timing
- **Network layer mapping**: Track public IP to internal IP translations

## Multi-Scenario Framework
Document consolidates multiple resolved cases providing pattern-based troubleshooting approach for connectivity failures across different deployment scenarios.

## Advanced Analysis Requirements
- **Packet capture coordination**: Client-side and gateway-side capture timing
- **VSX considerations**: Virtual system-specific connection tracking
- **SSL/TLS handshake analysis**: Protocol-level failure identification

## Research Context
Comprehensive connectivity troubleshooting methodology for complex enterprise deployments.

## Connection Potential
- Links to packet capture analysis techniques
- Connects to SSL/TLS troubleshooting patterns
- Related to VSX and virtual system connectivity issues
