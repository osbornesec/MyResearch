- **Purpose**: Centralized configuration for all quality standards
- **Features**:
  - Customizable thresholds and limits
  - Rule definitions for different content types
  - Enforcement mode configurations
  - Domain-specific requirements
- **Location**: `/00-System/Configuration/quality-rules.yaml`
- **Auto-created**: Generated on first script execution

### 4. Automation & Scheduling

#### Automated Execution Schedule
```bash
# Daily quick health check at 9 AM
0 9 * * * ./monitoring-orchestrator.sh quick

# Weekly full monitoring on Sundays at 10 AM  
0 10 * * 0 ./monitoring-orchestrator.sh full

# Quality gates check every 6 hours
0 */6 * * * ./quality-gates.sh recent

# Monthly comprehensive audit on 1st at 11 AM
0 11 1 * * ./monitoring-orchestrator.sh audit
```

#### Integration Hooks
- Automatic PKM integration triggers
- Spaced repetition session generation
- Vault intelligence updates
- Quality checkpoint creation

## üîß System Architecture

### Prevention-First Design
The monitoring system follows a **prevention-over-correction** philosophy:

1. **Quality Gates**: Prevent violations at creation time
2. **Regular Monitoring**: Early detection of emerging issues
3. **Automated Alerts**: Immediate notification of critical problems
4. **Integrated Learning**: Continuous education on atomic principles

### Three-Tier Monitoring Approach

#### Tier 1: Real-Time Quality Gates
- **Trigger**: Content creation/modification
- **Response**: Immediate feedback and enforcement
- **Tools**: `quality-gates.sh`

#### Tier 2: Regular Health Checks
- **Trigger**: Scheduled intervals (daily/weekly)
- **Response**: Trend analysis and proactive identification
- **Tools**: `atomic-compliance-monitor.sh`, `atomic-quality-check.sh`

#### Tier 3: Comprehensive Analysis
- **Trigger**: Monthly/quarterly reviews
- **Response**: Strategic planning and system optimization
- **Tools**: `monitoring-orchestrator.sh audit`
