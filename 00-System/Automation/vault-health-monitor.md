# Vault Health Monitor

*Automated systems for maintaining vault quality and intelligence*

## Overview

This system provides automated monitoring and maintenance to ensure optimal vault health, knowledge quality, and PKM effectiveness.

## Core Health Metrics

### 1. Knowledge Network Health
**Connection Density**
- **Target**: 3-7 meaningful connections per note
- **Monitoring**: Weekly analysis of link patterns
- **Alerts**: Notes with <2 or >10 connections flagged for review

**Orphan Detection**
- **Target**: <5% of notes without connections
- **Monitoring**: Daily scan for isolated content
- **Action**: Suggest connections or archive consideration

**Link Quality Assessment**
- **Target**: 90% functional links, meaningful relationships
- **Monitoring**: Broken link detection and relationship relevance
- **Maintenance**: Automated fixes where possible, manual review for complex cases

### 2. Content Quality Indicators
**Information Freshness**
- **Active Content**: Updated within 90 days
- **Stable Reference**: Unchanged for 90+ days but frequently accessed
- **Stale Content**: Unchanged for 180+ days with low access
- **Archival Candidates**: Unchanged for 365+ days with no recent access

**Content Completeness**
- **Metadata Presence**: Title, tags, creation date, domain classification
- **Template Compliance**: Proper use of established templates
- **Cross-References**: Adequate linking to related content
- **Documentation Quality**: Clear, searchable, actionable content

### 3. Learning System Integration
**Review Schedule Compliance**
- **Spaced Repetition Coverage**: Important concepts included in review system
- **Review Completion Rate**: Target 85% completion of scheduled reviews
- **Mastery Progression**: Concepts advancing through mastery levels
- **Knowledge Gap Detection**: Areas lacking review coverage

**Active Recall Effectiveness**
- **Question Quality**: Questions that reliably test understanding
- **Success Rate Optimization**: 85-90% success rate for optimal challenge
- **Context Variation**: Knowledge tested in multiple contexts
- **Application Integration**: Successful transfer to real-world use

## Automated Monitoring Scripts

### Daily Health Check
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# vault-daily-health.sh

echo "=== Vault Daily Health Check ==="
echo "Date: $(date)"

# Check for orphaned notes
echo "--- Orphan Analysis ---"
orphan_count=$(find . -name "*.md" -exec grep -L "\[\[.*\]\]" {} \; | wc -l)
echo "Orphaned notes: $orphan_count"

# Check for broken links
echo "--- Link Integrity ---"
echo "Scanning for broken internal links..."
# Implementation would use specific link checking logic

# Recent activity summary
echo "--- Recent Activity ---"
echo "Notes modified in last 24h: $(find . -name "*.md" -mtime -1 | wc -l)"
echo "New notes created: $(find . -name "*.md" -mtime -1 -newer .last_check | wc -l)"

# Knowledge capture rate
echo "--- Capture Metrics ---"
echo "Notes in inbox: $(find ./00-System/Inbox -name "*.md" | wc -l)"
echo "Processing backlog: $(find ./00-System/Inbox -name "*.md" -mtime +2 | wc -l)"
```
