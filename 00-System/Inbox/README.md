# ðŸ“¥ Inbox

This folder serves as a quick capture zone for new ideas, links, and notes that need to be processed and organized.

## How to Use
1. **Quick Capture**: Drop any new ideas, links, or temporary notes here
2. **Regular Processing**: Review and move items to appropriate locations during weekly reviews
3. **Don't Let It Pile Up**: Process inbox items within a week

## Processing Workflow
1. **Identify the Type**: Research note, project idea, reference material, etc.
2. **Determine Domain**: Which numbered folder (01-05) does it belong to?
3. **Apply Template**: Use appropriate template from `00-System/Templates/`
4. **Create Connections**: Link to existing notes and MOCs
5. **Move to Final Location**: Remove from inbox once properly organized

## File Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names with date prefix for temporary items
- Example: `2024-01-15-interesting-ai-research-link.md`
- This makes it easy to see what needs processing first
