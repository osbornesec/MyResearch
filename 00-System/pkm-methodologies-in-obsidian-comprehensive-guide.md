## Popular PKM Methods

### 1. Zettelkasten Method

#### **Core Principles**
- **Atomicity**: Each note contains a single idea
- **Linking**: Notes are interconnected, forming a network
- **Progressive Development**: Ideas evolve through continuous reflection
- **Emergence**: New insights arise from connections within the network

#### **Obsidian Implementation**

**Vault Structure:**
```
Zettelkasten/
├── Zettels/                 # Main atomic notes
├── Literature Notes/        # Source summaries
├── Permanent Notes/         # Refined ideas
├── MOCs/                   # Maps of Content
└── Templates/              # Note templates
```

**Naming Conventions:**
- Timestamp-based: `202506120957` (classic Luhmann style)
- Descriptive titles: `Feedback Loops in Learning` (modern approach)
- Optional prefixes: `LIT_`, `PERM_`, `MOC_`

**Workflow Process:**
1. **Capture** fleeting notes for immediate observations
2. **Create literature notes** from sources
3. **Develop permanent notes** (atomic, evergreen)
4. **Link prolifically** using `[[WikiLinks]]`
5. **Create MOCs** for navigation and synthesis
6. **Review and refine** regularly

**Example Zettel:**
```markdown
---
created: 2025-06-12
tags: #learning #feedback
---

# Feedback Loops in Learning

Effective learning often depends on immediate and specific feedback, 
enabling iterative improvement.

## Linked Notes
- [[Active Recall in Memorization]]
- [[Formative Assessment Techniques]]

### 2. PARA Method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)

#### **Core Structure**
- **Projects**: Short-term efforts with clear goals and deadlines
- **Areas**: Long-term responsibilities with ongoing standards
- **Resources**: Reference materials for future use
- **Archives**: Inactive items from other categories

#### **Obsidian Implementation**

**Vault Structure:**
```

### 3. Building a Second Brain (BASB) / CODE Method

#### **Core Framework**
- **Capture**: Save valuable information
- **Organize**: Structure for actionability (often using PARA)
- **Distill**: Highlight and summarize key insights
- **Express**: Transform knowledge into output

#### **Obsidian Implementation**

**Progressive Summarization Process:**
```markdown
# Article Title

## Executive Summary
**Key insight in bold** - main takeaway

## Original Content
Regular text with **highlighted passages** in bold.

Some passages are ==highlighted== and others are **bolded for emphasis**.

> [!important] Core Insight

```

**Workflow Process:**
1. **Capture** using daily notes or inbox system
2. **Organize** into PARA structure
3. **Distill** through progressive summarization
4. **Express** by creating outputs and sharing knowledge

**Example Note Evolution:**
```markdown
# First Pass - Capture
Long excerpt from article about productivity...

# Second Pass - Organize & Highlight
Long excerpt with **key phrases highlighted**...

# Third Pass - Distill
## Summary
The core principle is that **small consistent actions** 
compound over time to create significant results.

# Fourth Pass - Express
## Application
- Apply to daily writing habit
- Create system for tracking progress
- Share insight in next team meeting
```

**Pros:**
- Output-focused and practical

## Conclusion

The choice of PKM methodology in Obsidian should align with your primary use case, personal preferences, and workflow requirements. While each method has distinct advantages, the most effective approach often involves combining elements from multiple methodologies to create a personalized system that evolves with your needs.

The key to success is starting simple, maintaining consistency, and gradually adding complexity as you become more comfortable with the system. Remember that the best PKM system is the one you actually use consistently, not necessarily the most sophisticated one.

Whether you choose a single methodology or create a hybrid approach, focus on building habits around capture, connection, and review. These fundamental practices will serve you well regardless of the specific organizational structure you choose.
