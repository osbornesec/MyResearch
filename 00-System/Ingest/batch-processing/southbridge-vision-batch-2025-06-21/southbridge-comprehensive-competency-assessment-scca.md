## Part 1: Competency Assessment

### 1. Writing code
Converting tight specifications into executable code within the needed stack and timelines. This ranges from quick POCs demonstrating effectiveness to production-ready, maintainable systems. Understanding this range and delivering appropriate solutions on time is the core of this competency.

### 2. Testing new things
Rapidly evaluating new AI tools, models, and techniques as they're released, testing them thoroughly enough (with personal eval sets or intuitive understanding) to determine their capabilities and limitations. This competency is measured through the experience of consistently doing this work and effectively communicating findings so they become organizational knowledge rather than just personal insights.

### 3. Discovery with people
Extracting valuable insights from large human audiences, both online and IRL. This includes qualifying potential leads, building rapport quickly, asking insightful questions, and transforming conversations into actionable intelligence about markets, competitors, and opportunities.

### 4. Speccing things out
Facing the uncertainty of all possible paths and determining what's feasible now versus far away. This involves shifting focus from the forest to individual trees, structuring and positioning work so it can be executed sequentially in a team setting. The key is breaking work into small enough pieces that can actually be executed by humans or AI in reasonable time while maintaining a coherent overall direction.

### 5. Research writing
Creating credible, evidence-based content like research papers, technical documentation, or patents that establish our AI expertise. This requires synthesizing complex information, maintaining scientific rigor, and balancing thoroughness with reasonable time constraints.

### 6. New ideas
Generating novel, actionable concepts that create unique opportunities for Southbridge. This requires connecting seemingly unrelated domains, questioning assumptions, and balancing creative exploration with technical and market realities.

### 7. Marketing
Crafting and implementing strategies to build awareness, generate interest, and communicate Southbridge's value to target audiences. This encompasses positioning, content creation, channel selection, and campaign execution.

### 8. Sales opening
Identifying prospects, generating initial interest, and getting first meetings with potential customers. This requires identifying decision-makers, quickly assessing fit, crafting compelling introductory pitches tailored to specific pain points, and creating enough interest to advance to deeper discussions.

### 9. Sales closing
Guiding qualified prospects from initial interest to signed agreements and successful implementation. This involves deeper needs assessment, tailoring solutions, navigating procurement processes, handling objections, negotiating terms, and creating momentum toward decision-making.

### 11. Architecture and large scale code work
Designing and implementing technical systems that can handle complexity and scale as our user base and data volumes grow. This involves making strategic technology decisions, creating clean abstractions, and establishing patterns that enable others to build effectively while minimizing future rework, in a way that's supported by AI-accelerated development.

### 12. AI expertise in tools
Effectively leveraging existing AI services and platforms to solve specific business problems without reinventing the wheel. This includes evaluating available AI capabilities, integrating them into workflows, and optimizing their use for cost and performance while understanding their limitations, both on a personal and company level.

### 13. AI expertise in models and dev
Technical AI expertise - both at the model level and the engineering level, and using them to figure out new solutions that haven't existed before.

### 14. Fundraising
Securing financial resources to support the company's growth through investor relationships and compelling pitches. This includes identifying the right investors, articulating our value proposition in financial terms, navigating due diligence, and negotiating favorable terms while maintaining the integrity of our vision.

### 15. Emerging markets and dynamics
Identifying, analyzing, and capitalizing on evolving market trends and competitive dynamics in the AI space. This includes spotting patterns in industry developments, recognizing untapped opportunities before competitors, and helping Southbridge position itself advantageously as the landscape shifts.

### 16. Customer relationship management
Building and nurturing strong relationships with existing customers to ensure their success, identify expansion opportunities, and transform them into advocates. This involves regular communication, proactive problem solving, understanding evolving needs, and developing strategic partnerships rather than transactional relationships.

### 17. Design
Creating intuitive, effective user interfaces and experiences that make our complex AI capabilities accessible and valuable. This encompasses UI/UX work, visual design systems, and product packaging that balances aesthetics with functionality while reflecting our brand identity.

### 18. Content
Creating high-quality written, visual, or multimedia material that educates, persuades, or builds our brand. This includes blog posts, whitepapers, social media, newsletters, videos, and documentation that demonstrate our expertise while serving specific strategic goals.

### 20. Building new skills in realtime
Rapidly acquiring and applying new capabilities in response to immediate business needs or emerging opportunities. This involves self-directed learning, pattern recognition across domains, and quickly reaching functional proficiency in areas outside your core expertise when circumstances demand it.

### 21. Positioning and packaging
The ability to look ahead and understand copy, micro and macro positioning to catch the right tailwinds in narrative, and speak to pain points in a way that attracts inbound. For the same internal work and output, determining the best packaging to maximize impact and relevance.

## Part 2: Reflection Questions

### Core vs. Aspirational Competencies
Where do you see the core competencies and aspirational competencies currently distributed in the team? For each team member (Hrishi, Minu, Alok, and Jay), list what you perceive as their:
- Top 3 current core competencies
- Top 2 aspirational competencies they should develop

### What am I uniquely good at?
What competencies do you believe you bring to Southbridge that are most distinctive and valuable?

### What's an acceptable setback?
In which areas are you comfortable with occasionally falling short while you're learning and growing?

### Unique competency
What skill or ability do you have that might not be captured in the standard competencies but provides value to Southbridge?

### Competency gaps
What critical competencies do you believe Southbridge needs that aren't adequately covered by the founding team right now?

### Ideal role composition
If you could design your perfect role at Southbridge, what percentage of time would you spend on each of your top 5 competencies?

### Support needs
What resources, training, or support would most help you develop in your priority areas?

### Team dynamics
How could we better structure our roles and responsibilities to leverage each team member's strengths?

### Decision making
How should we allocate decision-making authority across different competency areas?

## Conclusion and Next Steps

After completing this assessment, we'll compile the results and analyze them collectively to:

- **Map our team's competency landscape** - Understanding our collective strengths, gaps, and growth areas
- **Clarify RACI assignments** - Establishing primary ownership and support roles for key competencies
- **Align on development priorities** - Identifying which competencies each team member should focus on developing
- **Structure roles effectively** - Designing roles that leverage natural strengths while providing growth opportunities
- **Identify external needs** - Determining where we might need additional hires or partners to fill critical gaps

This assessment isn't a one-time exercise but the foundation for ongoing conversations about our evolving roles, responsibilities, and development priorities. We'll revisit it quarterly to track progress and adjust as the company and our individual aspirations evolve.

Thank you for your thoughtful participation. Your candid self-reflection and constructive assessment of teammates will help build a stronger Southbridge where everyone can contribute meaningfully and grow professionally.
