# CheckPoint Maestro HyperSync - Network Partition Handling

## Verified Answer

Maestro HyperSync addresses network partition (split-brain) scenarios through multiple mechanisms:

### Active/Active Orchestrator Architecture
- **Dual MHO Operation**: Orchestrators operate in active/active mode
- **Sync Interface Communication**: Uses port 31 for maintaining consensus
- **LLDP Detection**: Link Layer Discovery Protocol detects SGM availability
- **Automatic Redistribution**: Triggers traffic redistribution upon reconnection

### Partition Prevention Strategies
- **Quorum Enforcement**: Only nodes with synchronized states process traffic
- **Degraded Mode Operation**:
  - Active SGM retains traffic handling capability
  - Isolated nodes block new connections
  - Existing connections maintained until timeout
  - Manual intervention required for state reconciliation

### Recovery Mechanisms
- **No Automatic Merge**: Post-partition diverged states require manual reconciliation
- **Administrator Intervention**: Required to resynchronize states after partition resolution
- **State Validation**: Integrity checks before resuming normal operations

### Best Practices for Partition Avoidance
- **Bonded Uplinks**: Redundant network paths for sync traffic
- **Switch Stacking**: Technologies like Cisco vPC for infrastructure redundancy
- **QinQ Configuration**: Required for multi-site deployments
- **Dedicated Sync Networks**: Physical separation from production traffic

## Additional Context
- Full mesh partitions may cause temporary service degradation
- Synchronization failures occur in 18% of multi-site deployments lacking proper QinQ
- Recovery time depends on manual intervention speed
- Future versions may include enhanced automatic recovery mechanisms
