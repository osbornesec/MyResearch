# CheckPoint Maestro Setup - Licensing Requirements and Management

## Verified Answer

Maestro has specific licensing requirements that differ from traditional deployments:

### Orchestrator Licensing
- **No License Required**: MHO units do not require any licenses
- **Management Only**: Orchestrators are pure traffic distribution devices

### Security Gateway Licensing
- **License Requirement**: Each Security Appliance needs valid gateway license
- **License Binding**: Tied to:
  - Sync Interface IP address
  - Management Interface MAC address
- **License Generation Schema**:

| Appliance ID | Sync Interface IP | Mgmt MAC | Description |
|--------------|-------------------|----------|-------------|
| CP6400-01 | 192.168.10.5 | 00:1C:7F:AE:01 | Core_DC_FW |

### License Management Process
1. **Collection Phase**:
   - Gather Sync IP for each gateway
   - Record Management MAC addresses
   - Document in required format

2. **Generation Phase**:
   - Submit to Check Point UserCenter
   - Specify Maestro deployment type
   - Include all gateways in Security Group

3. **Installation Phase**:
   - Install via SmartConsole
   - Licenses deploy to individual gateways
   - Verify status in gateway properties

### Common License Issues
- **IP Mismatch**: License IP must match Sync interface IP exactly
- **Deployment Errors**: SGMs reject policies if license validation fails
- **VSX Licensing**: Each Virtual System requires separate license

### License Activation Keys
- Used for SIC initialization, not licensing
- Different from product licenses
- Required for certificate establishment
