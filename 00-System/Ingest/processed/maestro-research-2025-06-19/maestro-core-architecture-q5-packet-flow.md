# CheckPoint Maestro Core Architecture - Packet Flow

## Verified Answer

CheckPoint Maestro implements a sophisticated packet flow architecture:

### Ingress Processing Flow
1. **Packet Arrival**: Incoming packets hit Orchestrator uplink interfaces
2. **ECMP Hashing**: Orchestrator performs hash calculation based on 5-tuple
3. **Gateway Assignment**: Packets distributed to specific SGM based on hash result
4. **SecureXL Acceleration**: Fast path processing for 90%+ of traffic
5. **CoreXL Distribution**: Multi-core firewall instance processing
6. **Threat Inspection**: Deep packet inspection and threat prevention
7. **Egress Decision**: Forward or drop based on security policy

### Key Optimizations
- **SecureXL Fast Path**: Template-based rule matching for accelerated processing
- **Priority Queues**: Bandwidth guarantee for control traffic (BGP/HA) during floods
- **HyperFlow (R81.20)**: Elephant flow detection with dynamic core allocation (3x throughput improvement)
- **Latency**: 300 nanosecond port-to-port orchestrator latency

### Correction Layer Workflow
For asymmetric routing scenarios:
1. Gateway receives non-session-initiating packet
2. Queries HyperSync state database
3. Forwards to correct gateway via internal VLAN
4. Applies security policy
5. Adds ≤50μs latency for correction

### Distribution Modes
- **Auto-Topology (Default)**: Intelligent mode selection based on network position
- **Perimeter Mode (NAT)**: Source IP hashing with Layer 4 optimization
- **Data Center Mode (No NAT)**: Destination IP hashing
- **Manual Override**: Available but not recommended

## Source Verification
- **Primary Sources**: Check Point Maestro Performance Tuning Guide, Architecture Documentation
- **Credibility**: Official vendor performance guides
- **Verification Method**: Technical details cross-referenced with performance benchmarks
- **Last Updated**: 2025

## Additional Context
- L4-mode should be disabled unless advised by Check Point support
- Correction Layer essential for maintaining session persistence with NAT
- Performance scales linearly with additional gateways
- Packet distribution algorithm ensures even load across all SGMs
