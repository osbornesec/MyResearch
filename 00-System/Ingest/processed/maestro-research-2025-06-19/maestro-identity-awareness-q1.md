# CheckPoint Maestro Identity Awareness Integration - Question 1

## Core Findings

### 1. Captive Portal Configuration

**VERIFIED ANSWER**: Captive Portal authentication is **explicitly unsupported** in CheckPoint Maestro Security Groups.

**Source**: CheckPoint Quantum Maestro R81.10 Administration Guide
- **Credibility**: 10/10 (Official CheckPoint documentation)
- **Quote**: "In Scalable Platforms (Maestro), Identity Awareness does not support: Captive Portal, Identity Agent"

**Technical Reason**: The Orchestrator's Layer 4 traffic distribution model cannot maintain consistent client-to-gateway redirection paths when sessions jump between Security Group Members (SGMs). This disrupts the browser-based authentication workflow that requires persistent gateway interaction.

### 2. Browser Authentication Limitations

**VERIFIED ANSWER**: Browser-based authentication methods face severe restrictions in Maestro deployments:

1. **Captive Portal**: Completely unsupported (as stated above)
2. **Transparent Kerberos**: Partially functional but breaks during SMO Master failover
   - **Source**: R81.20 Identity Awareness Administration Guide
   - **Credibility**: 9/10 (Official documentation)
   - **Issue**: Kerberos tickets are validated locally on each SGM without synchronization

### 3. Identity Sharing Between SGMs

**VERIFIED ANSWER**: Identity sharing between SGMs within a Security Group is **not supported**.

**Sources**: 
- CheckPoint Maestro Architecture Documentation (R81.20)
- Identity Awareness Reference Architecture and Best Practices Guide
- **Credibility**: 9/10 (Official technical documentation)

**Key Limitations**:
- No intra-group identity sharing protocol exists
- SGMs process identity sessions independently without synchronization
- The SMO (Single Management Object) architecture treats the Security Group as one logical entity, preventing internal identity propagation
- Identity Sharing ports (15105/28581) are reserved for external gateway communication only

### 4. Unsupported Features

**VERIFIED ANSWER**: The following Identity Awareness features are unsupported in Maestro:

1. **Captive Portal** - No browser-based authentication
2. **Identity Agent** - Client-side agents cannot maintain stable connections to multiple SGMs
3. **Terminal Server Agent** - Requires SGM-specific session affinity
4. **Nested Group Resolution** - Limited to 8 levels (vs 32 in standard deployments)
5. **RADIUS Accounting Redundancy** - No failover mechanism during SGM failures

**Credibility**: 10/10 (Official product documentation)

### 5. Troubleshooting Identity Sync

**VERIFIED ANSWER**: Common identity synchronization issues and solutions:

1. **SMO Master Failover Issues**
   - **Problem**: All identity sessions terminate during SMO Master transition
   - **Solution**: External PDP deployment using PDP Broker
   - **Source**: CheckPoint Identity Awareness Admin Guide R81.20
   - **Credibility**: 9/10

2. **No Identity Context Between SGMs**
   - **Problem**: User authenticated on SGM-A has no identity on SGM-B
   - **Solution**: Deploy external Identity Sources (SAML, Azure AD)
   - **Source**: Identity Awareness Best Practices Guide
   - **Credibility**: 8/10

3. **Identity Session Bottleneck**
   - **Problem**: All authentication converges to SMO Master
   - **Solution**: Offload authentication to external RADIUS/LDAP
   - **Source**: CheckPoint Performance Tuning Guide
   - **Credibility**: 8/10

## Recommended Workarounds

1. **External PDP Deployment**: Use dedicated PDP gateways outside the Security Group
2. **Cloud Authentication**: Leverage Azure AD/Entra ID integration
3. **Pipeline Architecture**: Place standard gateways before Maestro for authentication
