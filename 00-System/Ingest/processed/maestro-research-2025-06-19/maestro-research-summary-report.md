- **Certified Training Materials**: 10% of answers
- **Community Resources**: 5% of answers (validated against official sources)

## Recommendations

1. **For Implementation Teams**:
   - Follow mandatory bonding requirements for all interfaces
   - Use auto-topology distribution mode unless specific requirements exist
   - Plan for manual intervention in network partition scenarios

2. **For Architecture Planning**:
   - Consider memory overhead when sizing deployments
   - Ensure ≤1ms latency for dual-site synchronization
   - Start with minimal configuration and scale incrementally

3. **For Operations Teams**:
   - Establish baseline performance metrics using `asg perf`
   - Document SIC activation keys securely
   - Implement regular certificate validation checks

## Conclusion

All 15 research questions were successfully answered with verified sources meeting or exceeding the 7/10 credibility threshold. The research confirms CheckPoint Maestro as a mature hyperscale security platform with comprehensive documentation, though some advanced scenarios (particularly network partition recovery) would benefit from expanded official guidance.
