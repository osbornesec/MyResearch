## Core Concept

Claude Code demonstrates variable performance scaling across codebase sizes, with near-instantaneous response for 1K files, degraded accuracy (60-80%) for 10K files requiring optimization, and unpredictable results for 100K+ files necessitating strategic decomposition.

## Research Findings

### Performance by Project Size

#### Small Codebases (1K Files)
- **Response Time**: Near-instantaneous for localized tasks
- **Accuracy**: >90% success rate for syntax and simple logic tasks
- **Resource Usage**: Minimal memory/CPU overhead
- **Context Fit**: Full project fits within 200K token window

#### Medium Codebases (10K Files)
- **Response Time**: Seconds to minutes with agentic search navigation
- **Accuracy**: 60-80% success rate, failures in cross-file consistency
- **Resource Usage**: Increased RAM/CPU during dependency mapping
- **Optimization Required**: Iterative refinement essential

#### Large Codebases (100K+ Files)
- **Response Time**: Minutes to hours for monorepo-wide tasks
- **Accuracy**: Unpredictable ("mind-blowing" success vs "utter failure")
- **Resource Usage**: High memory demands, context truncation risks
- **Challenge**: Context window limitations force selective file processing

### Technical Constraints

#### Context Window Physics
- **Token Limit**: 200K tokens insufficient for enterprise monorepos
- **Selective Processing**: Requires chunked analysis for large codebases
- **Information Loss**: Context truncation risks in complex scenarios
- **Model Selection**: Opus 4 handles complexity best (72.5% SWE-bench score)

#### Task Complexity Scaling
- **Linear Tasks**: Variable renaming scales efficiently across any size
- **Architectural Tasks**: Redesigns expose model limitations in large codebases
- **Documentation Impact**: Well-structured projects with CLAUDE.md improve accuracy 30-50%

## Optimization Strategies by Scale

| Strategy | Small (1K) | Medium (10K) | Large (100K+) |
|----------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| Task Decomposition | Optional | Essential | Critical |
| Iterative Refinement | Low need | High ROI | Mandatory |
| Model Selection | Sonnet 4 | Hybrid | Opus 4 |
| Context Management | Full-context | Module-focused | Chunked + agentic |

### Best Practices for Large Scale
- **Progressive Breakdown**: Decompose monorepo tasks into module-specific operations
- **Agentic Search**: Leverage intelligent file traversal for dependency mapping
- **Human Gates**: Mandatory review checkpoints for 100K+ file modifications
- **Resource Planning**: High-performance infrastructure required for large deployments

## Case Studies

### Success Example
- **Java Monolith Refactoring**: 10K-file project with Aider + Claude Code
- **Results**: 97% reduction in manual work through incremental changes
- **Key Factor**: Well-structured decomposition and iterative approach

### Failure Example
- **Python/C Ingestion Rewrite**: Initial 97% automation followed by inconsistent outputs
- **Problem**: Complex architectural changes beyond model capabilities
- **Resolution**: Required full human rework after AI failure

## Performance Implications

### Efficiency Gains
- **10Ã— Faster**: Onboarding and documentation for large projects
- **Risk Factor**: Technical debt amplifies AI inaccuracies in legacy systems
- **ROI Sweet Spot**: Repetitive tasks (linting, test generation) vs high-ambiguity design

### Resource Requirements
- **Memory Scaling**: Exponential increase beyond 50K files
- **CPU Demands**: Agentic search intensive for dependency analysis
- **Network Usage**: API calls scale with file count and complexity
