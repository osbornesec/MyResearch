## Core Concept

Claude Code implements a three-tiered memory architecture combining transient session context, project-specific memory files, and global instructions through cascaded CLAUDE.md files, with performance degradation following predictable patterns during 8+ hour development sessions.

## Research Findings

### Memory Architecture
- **Context Window**: 200,000-token working memory buffer containing conversational history, code snippets, and referenced documentation
- **Cascaded Memory**: Hierarchical system prioritizing instructions from global ($HOME/.claude/CLAUDE.md) and project-specific CLAUDE.md files
- **Token Burn Rate**: Averages $6/developer/day with 90th percentile at $12/day

### Performance Decay Patterns
- **Hours 1-3**: Maintain 92-95% baseline accuracy
- **Hours 4-6**: Show 15-20% decay in complex reasoning tasks
- **Beyond 7 hours**: Require explicit context optimization commands
- **Context Window Utilization**: Performance degradation beyond 95% capacity triggers 37-42% increase in hallucination frequency

### Memory Retention Characteristics
- **Asymmetric Forgetting**: Architectural patterns persist longer than implementation details
- **Knowledge Half-life**: Critical project knowledge 5.2 hours vs 2.1 hours for peripheral details
- **Context Loss**: Cross-session amnesia requiring manual context rebuilding

## Optimization Strategies

### Best Practices for Long Sessions
- **Context Preservation**: Use `#important` annotations in CLAUDE.md for persistence across sessions
- **Strategic Compaction**: `/compact` command reduces token consumption by 32% while preserving critical context
- **Session Partitioning**: Heavy refactoring before hour 3, code reviews hour 4-6
- **Maintenance Protocols**: Nightly memory dumps to CLAUDE.md with structured checklists

### Technical Implementation
```bash
# Initialize session with context restoration
/claude --resume
/compact focus=architecture

# Create maintenance checklist
echo "## Session Priorities" > SCRATCH.md
echo "- [ ] Refactor authentication module" >> SCRATCH.md
```
