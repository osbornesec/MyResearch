## Core Concept

Claude Code provides distinct integration patterns for VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, and Sublime Text, with VS Code offering the most seamless terminal/editor synergy and productivity gains of 40-60% in validated studies.

## Research Findings

### VS Code Integration (Primary Platform)
- **Installation**: Global npm install + OAuth authentication flow
- **Key Features**: Real-time diagnostic sharing, selection context transmission, GitHub Actions pipeline integration
- **Productivity Impact**: 97% reduction in onboarding time for legacy Python systems (Thoughtworks case study)
- **Keybindings**: `Cmd+Esc` activation, `Cmd+Option+K` for file referencing

### JetBrains Integration (Enterprise Focus)
- **Specializations**: Structural search with AST parsing, dynamic tooltips with confidence scores, multi-session support
- **Limitations**: Annotation processor conflicts (e.g., Lombok), requires full IDE restart for activation
- **Remote Development**: Host-side installation required for Docker/SSH environments

### Sublime Text Integration (Community-Driven)
- **Plugins**: SublimeClaudette and Claudette (GitHub community packages)
- **Constraints**: No terminal emulation, limited diagnostics, manual context selection
- **Performance Impact**: 30% longer task completion times vs VS Code due to context-switching overhead

## Comparative Analysis

| Feature | VS Code | JetBrains | Sublime Text |
|---------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Auto-install | Terminal trigger | Terminal trigger | Manual plugin |
| Diagnostic sharing | Real-time | On-save | Manual |
| Remote development | ✓ Dev Containers | ✓ Remote Host | ✗ |
| GitHub integration | ✓ Actions pipeline | ✓ Custom configs | ✗ |

## Workflow Optimization Techniques

### Configuration Best Practices
- **CLAUDE.md Files**: Project-specific documentation with coding conventions and build commands
- **Session Branching**: Git worktree for parallel feature development
- **Structured Prompting**: Replace vague requests with explicit constraints and requirements

### Enterprise Implementation
- **OAuth Integration**: Seamless authentication across development environments
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: `/install-github-app` for automated PR generation with test validation
- **Cost Monitoring**: Configure allowlists via `/permissions` to block expensive operations

## Troubleshooting Procedures

### Common Issues
- **Permission Errors**: npm global prefix misconfiguration
- **Authentication Loops**: Delete cached credentials and re-authenticate
- **Plugin Inactive**: Verify host-side installation for remote development

### Performance Optimization
- **Model Selection**: Default to Sonnet 4 for routine tasks, reserve Opus 4 for architectural changes
- **Token Management**: Use `/compact` for context optimization, `/clear` between unrelated tasks
