## Overview

Our problem is simple. We need to estimate the macros in this thing - and this image is all we have to go on.

We're going to give this problem to three multimodal models, then join the results with two CoT models, and see how we do.

## Prompt
[The specific prompt used for the models was not fully captured]

## Initial estimations

### Models tested:
- Claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
- 4o
- Gemini-exp-1121

## Results 1

Let's plot the results (we'll use an average for ranges) and look at deviation.

### Variance across results
[Specific variance data not fully captured]

## Joining

What if we have all three estimates to o1-preview and QwQ?

### Prompt
[The joining prompt was not fully captured]

## Results 2

### Models:
- QwQ
- O1-preview

So what do we get?

| Item | Nutrient | QwQ | O1 | % Deviation |
|------|----------|-----|----|--------------|

## Conclusion

The results aren't very conclusive, but from a cursory look there's a lot more agreement across larger values.

The bagel's here so I might go eat it.
