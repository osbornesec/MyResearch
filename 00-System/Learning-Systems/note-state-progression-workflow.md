## Core Framework

This workflow system transforms fleeting research captures into permanent evergreen knowledge through systematic quality evolution and connection enhancement.

### State Definitions

#### Fleeting State
**Characteristics:**
- Initial capture of ideas, insights, or information
- Minimal structure and connections
- Content may be incomplete or unrefined
- Primarily serves as memory aid or placeholder

**Criteria:**
- Single concept focus (atomic principle)
- Basic frontmatter populated
- Minimal connection requirements (0-1 links)
- Content captures essential insight

#### Permanent State
**Characteristics:**
- Refined, self-contained concept presentation
- Strong connection network established
- Title functions as effective "concept API"
- Content enables teaching and synthesis

**Criteria:**
- ✅ Concept API title (clear, descriptive, searchable)
- ✅ Self-contained content (context-independent understanding)
- ✅ Minimum 3 meaningful connections established
- ✅ Semantic tags applied
- ✅ Review schedule optimized for importance

## Progression Workflow

### Phase 1: Encounter-Driven Processing
**Trigger:** When fleeting note is accessed during active work
**Process:**
1. **Title Refinement Check**
   - Does title clearly communicate the concept?
   - Is it searchable and memorable?
   - Does it function as effective API for the idea?

2. **Content Completeness Assessment**
   - Is the concept fully explained?
   - Can someone else understand it without additional context?
   - Are key relationships and implications clear?

3. **Connection Forcing**
   - Identify at least 3 related concepts in vault
   - Create meaningful links (not just associations)
   - Apply semantic relationship tags

### Phase 2: Quality Gate Evaluation
**Trigger:** When note meets minimum connection threshold (3+ links)
**Evaluation Criteria:**

#### Content Quality Gates
- [ ] **Atomic Principle**: Single, indivisible concept
- [ ] **Conceptual Completeness**: Fully explained without external dependencies
- [ ] **Clarity**: Understandable to future self and others
- [ ] **Actionability**: Can be applied or referenced in other contexts

#### Connection Quality Gates
- [ ] **Meaningful Relationships**: Links represent genuine conceptual connections
- [ ] **Semantic Diversity**: Multiple types of relationships (supports, builds-on, contrasts)
- [ ] **Network Integration**: Connects to different domains or concept clusters
- [ ] **Bidirectional Value**: Connections benefit both linked concepts

#### Metadata Quality Gates
- [ ] **Concept API Title**: Functions as effective interface to the idea
- [ ] **Semantic Tags**: Reflect genuine conceptual relationships
- [ ] **Review Frequency**: Appropriate for concept importance and stability
- [ ] **Evolution Tracking**: Changes documented with dates and reasons

### Phase 3: Permanent Status Transition
**Automatic Criteria:**
- All quality gates satisfied
- Minimum connection density achieved
- No critical content gaps identified
- Stable for 7+ days without major changes

**Manual Review Triggers:**
- Concepts central to current research
- Cross-domain synthesis opportunities
- High-impact insights requiring rapid promotion
- Foundational concepts requiring stability

### Phase 4: Continuous Evolution
**Ongoing Maintenance:**
- Connection density monitoring
- Content currency assessment
- Cross-domain application discovery
- Synthesis opportunity identification

## Implementation Mechanics

### Workflow Automation
```yaml
# Daily Processing Query
- state: fleeting
- last-reviewed: >7 days ago
- connections: >0
- sort: last-modified desc
- limit: 5

# Weekly Quality Review
- state: fleeting
- connections: >2
- created: >14 days ago
- sort: connections desc
- limit: 10

# Monthly Promotion Candidates
- state: fleeting
- connections: >3
- last-reviewed: >30 days ago
- sort: importance desc
```

### Quality Assurance Checkpoints

#### Daily Checkpoint (5 minutes)
- Review 3-5 fleeting notes accessed during work
- Apply encounter-driven processing
- Identify obvious promotion candidates

#### Weekly Deep Review (30 minutes)
- Process promotion candidates through quality gates
- Update connection networks
- Transition qualified notes to permanent status

#### Monthly System Health (60 minutes)
- Analysis of state distribution patterns
- Identification of stagnant fleeting notes
- Connection network optimization
- Process refinement based on usage patterns

### Integration with Existing Systems

#### Spaced Repetition Integration
- **Fleeting Notes**: Monthly review schedule
- **Permanent Notes**: Dynamic scheduling based on importance
- **Connection Reviews**: Quarterly deep connection analysis
- **Synthesis Opportunities**: Weekly pattern recognition

#### Vault Health Monitoring
- State distribution metrics
- Connection density analytics
- Promotion rate tracking
- Quality gate effectiveness measurement

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Indicators
- **Promotion Rate**: Fleeting → Permanent transitions per week
- **Connection Density**: Average connections per permanent note
- **Processing Efficiency**: Time from fleeting to permanent status
- **Network Growth**: Cross-domain connections created

### Qualitative Indicators
- **Synthesis Emergence**: Novel insights from connection patterns
- **Knowledge Accessibility**: Ease of finding and using concepts
- **Application Success**: Concepts successfully applied in practice
- **Cognitive Load**: Reduction in mental effort for knowledge access

## Risk Mitigation

### Over-Processing Prevention
- **Minimum Viable Permanence**: Focus on essential criteria only
- **Just-in-Time Processing**: Process only when accessed
- **Value Threshold**: Promote only concepts with demonstrated utility
- **Process Efficiency**: Streamline workflow to prevent abandonment

### Quality Drift Prevention
- **Regular Audits**: Periodic review of permanent note quality
- **Connection Validation**: Ensure links remain meaningful over time
- **Content Currency**: Update concepts as understanding evolves
- **Standard Enforcement**: Maintain consistent quality criteria

## Advanced Features

### Intelligent Promotion
- **Usage Pattern Analysis**: Promote frequently accessed concepts
- **Cross-Domain Significance**: Identify concepts with broad application
- **Synthesis Catalyst**: Promote concepts that enable insights
- **Teaching Utility**: Promote concepts useful for explanation

### Network-Based Enhancement
