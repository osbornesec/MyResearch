## Core Framework

Connection density drives knowledge network effects, enabling synthesis, discovery, and insight emergence. This system transforms isolated concepts into interconnected knowledge webs through systematic connection forcing, semantic relationship mapping, and synthesis catalyst deployment.

## Connection Types and Quality Framework

### Semantic Relationship Taxonomy

#### 1. Evidential Connections

**Syntax:** `#supports [[Claim]]` | `#refutes [[Claim]]`
**Quality Criteria:**
- Evidence directly relates to claim validity
- Source credibility and context provided
- Strength of evidential relationship specified

**Examples:**
```markdown
[[Spaced Repetition Performance Data]] #supports [[Forgetting Curve Optimization]]
[[Multi-Agent Coordination Overhead]] #refutes [[Unlimited Agent Scaling Benefits]]
```

#### 2. Causal Connections
**Function:** Show cause-and-effect relationships between concepts
**Syntax:** `#causes [[Effect]]` | `#enables [[Outcome]]` | `#prevents [[Problem]]`
**Quality Criteria:**

**Examples:**
```markdown
[[Atomic Note Structure]] #enables [[Flexible Knowledge Recombination]]

#### 6. Temporal Connections
**Function:** Establish chronological and developmental relationships
**Syntax:** `#precedes [[Later Concept]]` | `#evolves-from [[Earlier Form]]` | `#builds-on [[Foundation]]`
**Quality Criteria:**

## Connection Density Enhancement Strategies

### Strategy 1: Forced Connection Sessions
**Process:** Systematic exploration of relationship potential between concepts
**Implementation:**
1. **Random Pairing**: Select 2-3 unconnected concepts
2. **Relationship Exploration**: Apply each semantic type
3. **Value Assessment**: Identify genuinely meaningful connections
4. **Documentation**: Record connections with semantic tags
5. **Synthesis Testing**: Explore combination potential

**Session Template:**
```markdown
# Connection Forcing Session - {{date}}

## Concept Pair: [[Concept A]] × [[Concept B]]

### Semantic Relationship Analysis
- Evidential: Does A support/refute B?
- Causal: Does A cause/enable/prevent B?
- Hierarchical: Is A a type/instance of B?
- Analogical: Are A and B structurally similar?
- Compositional: Is A part of/composed of B?
- Temporal: Does A precede/evolve from B?

### Meaningful Connections Identified
- [ ] Connection 1: [Relationship description]
- [ ] Connection 2: [Relationship description]
- [ ] Synthesis opportunity: [Combination potential]

### Implementation
- [ ] Add semantic links to notes
- [ ] Update connection counts
- [ ] Schedule synthesis exploration
```

### Strategy 2: Domain Bridge Construction
**Purpose:** Create connections between different knowledge domains
**Method:**
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify structural similarities across domains
2. **Principle Transfer**: Apply concepts from one domain to another
3. **Analogical Mapping**: Establish deep structural correspondences
4. **Cross-Domain Synthesis**: Generate insights from domain combination

**Bridge Types:**
- **Cognitive Science → AI/ML**: Learning principles applied to AI systems
- **Business Analysis → Software Development**: Requirements methods in technical contexts
- **Systems Theory → PKM**: Network effects in knowledge management
- **Psychology → Team Coordination**: Individual cognitive principles scaled to teams

### Strategy 3: Connection Pattern Templates
**Template 1: Methodology Application Pattern**
```markdown
[[Method]] #applies-to [[Domain]]
[[Domain]] #benefits-from [[Method]]
[[Method + Domain]] #enables [[Enhanced Capability]]
```

**Template 2: Framework Comparison Pattern**
```markdown
[[Framework A]] #contrasts-with [[Framework B]]
[[Shared Foundation]] #underlies [[Both Frameworks]]
[[Hybrid Approach]] #combines [[Framework A]] and [[Framework B]]
```

**Template 3: Evolution Pattern**
```markdown
[[Basic Concept]] #evolves-to [[Advanced Concept]]
[[Catalyst]] #accelerates [[Evolution]]
[[Enhanced Capability]] #emerges-from [[Evolution]]
```
