## Quality Assurance Framework

This system establishes rigorous quality checkpoints that ensure only truly evergreen concepts achieve permanent status, maintaining high standards while enabling systematic knowledge evolution and synthesis acceleration.

## Permanent Status Qualification Framework

### Tier 1: Atomic Integrity Checkpoints

**Quality Gates:**
```yaml
atomicity_score: 0-10
- conceptual_unity: single coherent idea (0-3)

- clarity: immediately understandable (0-2)

minimum_threshold: 8/10
```

**Common Failure Patterns:**
