# Spaced Repetition Framework

*Optimized learning system for knowledge consolidation and recall*

## Overview

This framework implements evidence-based spaced repetition to transform your extensive vault knowledge into lasting memory and rapid recall capabilities.

## Core Principles

### 1. Forgetting Curve Optimization
- **Initial Review**: 1 day after first encounter
- **Second Review**: 3 days after initial review
- **Third Review**: 7 days after second review
- **Subsequent Reviews**: Expanding intervals based on recall success

### 2. Active Recall Integration
- **Question Generation**: Transform passive notes into active questions
- **Self-Testing**: Regular knowledge testing rather than re-reading
- **Elaborative Interrogation**: Deep "why" and "how" questions
- **Generation Effect**: Create content rather than just consume

### 3. Adaptive Scheduling
- **Success Adaptation**: Increase intervals for easily recalled items
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Decrease intervals for challenging concepts
- **Context Variation**: Test knowledge in different contexts
- **Interleaving**: Mix different types of content in review sessions

## Implementation for Current Vault

### Priority Knowledge for Spaced Repetition

#### Domain 01-AI-and-LLMs
**High Priority Concepts:**
- SCALES Framework components and applications
- PKM methodologies (PARA, Zettelkasten, LYT, GTD integration)
- AI planning methodologies and frameworks
- Prompt engineering techniques and patterns
- Cognitive science principles for knowledge management

**Sample Questions:**
```
Q: What are the 6 components of the SCALES framework and their primary functions?
A: S-Systematic Capture, C-Cognitive Load Management, A-Associative Organization, L-Learning-Optimized Retrieval, E-Evolutionary Synthesis, S-Scalable Maintenance

Q: How does spaced repetition optimize the forgetting curve?
A: By scheduling reviews at increasing intervals just before natural forgetting occurs, strengthening memory consolidation with each successful recall.

Q: What distinguishes evidential links from causal links in knowledge networks?
A: Evidential links connect claims with supporting/contradicting evidence, while causal links show cause-and-effect relationships between events or concepts.

### Active Recall Question Types

#### Factual Recall
- "What are the core components of..."
- "How does X differ from Y..."
- "What principles underlie..."

#### Conceptual Understanding
- "Why does X work better than Y in situation Z..."
- "How would you apply X to solve problem Y..."
- "What are the implications of X for Y..."

#### Synthesis and Application
- "How could you combine X and Y to create Z..."
- "What patterns connect X across domains Y and Z..."
- "How does principle X from domain Y apply to domain Z..."

## Integration with Vault Workflow

### 1. Content Creation Phase
**During note creation:**
- Generate 2-3 key questions for each important concept
- Identify connections to existing knowledge for review scheduling
- Tag concepts with review priority levels

### 2. Processing Phase
**During weekly reviews:**
- Convert insights into testable questions
- Schedule new concepts for spaced repetition
- Update existing questions based on evolving understanding

### 3. Synthesis Phase
**During synthesis sessions:**
- Use active recall to access relevant knowledge
- Test cross-domain connections through questioning
- Generate new questions from synthesis insights

## Automation Opportunities

### Question Generation
- **AI-Assisted**: Generate questions from note content automatically
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify question types that enhance understanding
- **Difficulty Calibration**: Adjust question complexity based on mastery level

### Scheduling Optimization
- **Success Tracking**: Monitor recall success rates and adjust intervals
- **Context Adaptation**: Vary question contexts for robust understanding
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute review load evenly across time periods

## Success Metrics

### Learning Effectiveness
- **Recall Success Rate**: Target 85-90% success rate for optimal challenge
- **Retention Duration**: Increasing intervals between successful recalls
- **Application Ability**: Successful use of knowledge in new contexts
- **Cross-Domain Transfer**: Knowledge successfully applied across domains

### System Health
- **Review Consistency**: Regular completion of scheduled reviews
- **Question Quality**: Questions that reliably test understanding
- **Coverage Completeness**: All important concepts included in system
- **Evolution Rate**: System adaptation to changing knowledge needs
