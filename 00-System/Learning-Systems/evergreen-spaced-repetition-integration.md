## Integration Framework

This system integrates spaced repetition principles with evergreen note evolution, creating dynamic review schedules that optimize knowledge consolidation while supporting continuous concept refinement and connection enhancement.

## Adaptive Review Scheduling Model

### State-Based Scheduling

#### Fleeting Notes
**Base Schedule:** Monthly review cycle
**Adaptive Factors:**
- Recent access frequency (increase review frequency for often-accessed notes)
- Connection development (accelerate review for notes gaining connections)
- Content evolution (schedule review after significant changes)
- Synthesis potential (prioritize notes showing combination opportunities)

**Dynamic Adjustments:**
```yaml
# High Activity Notes (accessed >5 times/month)
review_frequency: bi-weekly
promotion_candidacy: high

# Connection Rich Notes (>2 connections)
review_frequency: bi-weekly
connection_forcing: priority

# Synthesis Catalysts (enable combinations)
review_frequency: weekly
synthesis_exploration: scheduled
```

#### Permanent Notes
**Base Schedule:** Quarterly review cycle
**Adaptive Factors:**
- Concept stability (stable concepts get longer intervals)
- Application frequency (frequently used concepts get shorter intervals)
- Cross-domain significance (bridge concepts get priority scheduling)
- Teaching utility (concepts used for explanation get regular review)

**Dynamic Adjustments:**
```yaml
# Foundation Concepts (SCALES, MASS, PKM principles)
review_frequency: monthly
depth_review: comprehensive

# Active Application Concepts (current project relevance)
review_frequency: bi-weekly
application_testing: required

# Bridge Concepts (cross-domain connections)
review_frequency: monthly
synthesis_exploration: mandatory
```

### Importance-Weighted Scheduling

#### Importance Scoring Algorithm
```yaml
# Base Score Components
concept_centrality: 0-10 (connection count and quality)
application_frequency: 0-10 (usage in synthesis and projects)
cross_domain_value: 0-10 (bridges different knowledge areas)
teaching_utility: 0-10 (useful for explanation and instruction)

# Composite Importance Score
importance_score = (centrality * 0.3) + (application * 0.3) + (cross_domain * 0.2) + (teaching * 0.2)

# Schedule Adjustment
high_importance (8-10): review_frequency = base_frequency / 2
medium_importance (5-7): review_frequency = base_frequency
low_importance (0-4): review_frequency = base_frequency * 1.5
```

### Success-Based Interval Adjustment

#### Recall Success Tracking
**Success Metrics:**
- **Concept Recall**: Can explain concept clearly without reference
- **Connection Recall**: Can identify and explain relationships
- **Application Ability**: Can apply concept to new contexts
- **Synthesis Capability**: Can combine with other concepts for insights

**Interval Adjustments:**
```yaml
# Perfect Recall (all metrics satisfied)
interval_multiplier: 2.0
next_review: current_interval * 2

# Good Recall (3/4 metrics satisfied)
interval_multiplier: 1.5
next_review: current_interval * 1.5

# Partial Recall (2/4 metrics satisfied)
interval_multiplier: 1.0
next_review: current_interval (unchanged)

# Poor Recall (0-1 metrics satisfied)
interval_multiplier: 0.5
next_review: current_interval / 2
```

## Review Session Integration

### Evergreen Processing During Reviews

#### Standard Review Session Structure
1. **Concept Recall Test** (2-3 minutes)

   - Identify key relationships and applications
   - Generate examples or applications

2. **Evergreen Enhancement** (5-7 minutes)
   - Title optimization assessment
   - Content refinement opportunities
   - Connection forcing exercise
   - Synthesis exploration

3. **Evolution Documentation** (1-2 minutes)
   - Update evolution notes with changes
   - Adjust review frequency based on performance
   - Flag synthesis opportunities for future exploration

### Active Recall Integration

#### Question Generation During Reviews
**Automatic Question Creation:**
- Factual questions from concept content
- Relationship questions from connection network
- Application questions from usage contexts
- Synthesis questions from combination opportunities

**Question Types by Note State:**

**Fleeting Notes:**
- "What is the core concept of [note title]?"
- "How does this concept relate to [connected concepts]?"
- "In what contexts would you apply this concept?"

**Permanent Notes:**
- "Explain [concept] and its key implications"
- "How would you combine [concept A] with [concept B] to solve [problem]?"
- "What patterns connect [concept] across [domains]?"
- "How has your understanding of [concept] evolved over time?"

### Synthesis Acceleration Through Reviews

#### Connection Discovery During Review
**Systematic Relationship Exploration:**
1. Review existing connections for accuracy and value
2. Apply semantic relationship taxonomy to find new connections
3. Explore cross-domain application opportunities
4. Identify potential synthesis combinations
