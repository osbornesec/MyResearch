## Iterative Refinement Framework

This system creates continuous improvement cycles that automatically enhance note quality, optimize connection networks, and accelerate synthesis through intelligent automation and systematic refinement processes.

## Core Refinement Cycles

### Micro-Cycle: Daily Enhancement (Automated + Manual)

#### Automated Daily Processing
**Time: Continuous background processing**

```yaml
# Automated Quality Monitoring
connection_health_check:
  - scan_for_broken_links: identify dead or invalid connections
  - semantic_relationship_validation: verify relationship types remain accurate
  - bidirectional_value_assessment: ensure links benefit both concepts
  - connection_staleness_detection: flag outdated or irrelevant connections

content_quality_monitoring:
  - spelling_grammar_check: basic language quality assurance
  - factual_currency_alerts: flag concepts with time-sensitive information
  - completeness_assessment: identify concepts lacking essential information
  - clarity_score_tracking: monitor readability and comprehension metrics

network_analysis:
  - isolated_concept_detection: find notes with insufficient connections
  - cluster_formation_analysis: identify natural concept groupings
  - bridge_opportunity_identification: find potential cross-domain connections
  - synthesis_catalyst_recognition: identify concepts enabling combinations
```

#### Manual Daily Refinement (5-10 minutes)
**Process: Encounter-driven improvement during active work**

1. **Just-in-Time Enhancement**
   - When accessing a note during work, apply 2-3 minute refinement
   - Quick title optimization check
   - Immediate connection opportunities
   - Content completeness assessment

2. **Opportunistic Connection Forcing**
   - When working with multiple concepts, force connections between them
   - Apply semantic relationship taxonomy
   - Document synthesis opportunities discovered
   - Update connection metadata

3. **Synthesis Insight Capture**
   - Record novel combinations and insights as they emerge
   - Create new atomic notes for significant discoveries
   - Link insights back to source concepts
   - Schedule synthesis exploration sessions

### Meso-Cycle: Weekly Deep Refinement (30-45 minutes)
