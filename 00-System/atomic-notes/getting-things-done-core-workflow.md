# Getting Things Done Core Workflow

## Core Concept

GTD creates a trusted external system for managing commitments, freeing mental capacity for creative thinking and decision-making. The workflow transforms mental overhead into systematic processing through five distinct phases.

## Five-Phase Workflow

### 1. Capture
Collect everything requiring attention in trusted external systems. Capture eliminates mental task management by ensuring no commitment is forgotten or mentally held.

### 2. Clarify  
Process captured items to determine required actions and outcomes. Clarification transforms vague commitments into specific, actionable decisions.

### 3. Organize
Sort clarified items by context and priority into appropriate lists and systems. Organization enables efficient action selection based on available time, energy, and context.

### 4. Reflect
Review system regularly to maintain trust and currency. Reflection ensures the system remains reliable and aligned with changing priorities.

### 5. Engage
Take action based on context, time, and energy available. Engagement uses the trusted system to focus fully on chosen actions without mental overhead.

## Context-Based Organization

### Action Lists by Context
- **@work**: Actions requiring office environment or resources
- **@home**: Personal and domestic actions  
- **@computer**: Digital work requiring technology
- **@calls**: Phone-based communications
- **@errands**: Location-based tasks outside home/office

### Support Lists
- **Projects**: Multi-step outcomes requiring completion
- **Waiting For**: Delegated tasks and external dependencies
- **Someday/Maybe**: Future possibilities without current commitment

## Implementation Benefits

- **Mental Clarity**: External system eliminates cognitive overhead
- **Stress Reduction**: Trusted capture prevents forgotten commitments
- **Context Efficiency**: Grouping enables batch processing
- **Focus Enhancement**: Clear next actions enable deep engagement

## Success Requirements

- **Complete Capture**: All commitments must enter the external system
- **Regular Processing**: Weekly reviews maintain system trust
- **Context Discipline**: Consistent use of context-based organization
- **Action Clarity**: Next actions must be specific and doable

## Integration Opportunities

GTD workflows enhance other PKM systems by providing systematic action management, enabling knowledge workers to maintain both learning and productivity focus simultaneously.
