# VMAC Mode Cluster Addressing

## Core Concept

Virtual MAC (VMAC) mode in ClusterXL enables cluster members to share virtual MAC addresses for cluster interfaces, providing seamless Layer 2 failover without requiring external switch configuration or gratuitous ARP dependency.

## Technical Framework

**VMAC Address Structure:**
- Virtual MAC addresses assigned to cluster virtual interfaces
- Consistent MAC addressing across all cluster members
- Eliminates switch learning table updates during failover
- Reduces failover detection time at Layer 2

**Configuration Methods:**
1. **SmartConsole GUI:** Cluster object properties → ClusterXL → Enable VMAC mode
2. **Command Line:** `fw ctl set int fwha_vmac_global_param_enabled 1`

**Persistence Configuration:**
- Temporary: `fw ctl set int` command (lost on reboot)
- Permanent: Add to `$FWDIR/boot/modules/fwkern.conf`

## Implementation Benefits

**Failover Advantages:**
- Instantaneous Layer 2 failover without ARP table updates
- No dependency on gratuitous ARP packet processing
- Reduced network convergence time
- Improved failover reliability in VLAN environments

**Network Integration:**
- Transparent to upstream switches and routers
- Compatible with various switch vendor implementations
- Supports complex VLAN topologies
- Reduces broadcast traffic during failover events

## Operational Verification

**Status Commands:**
- `show cluster members interfaces all` (Gaia Clish)
- `cphaprob -a if` (Expert mode)
- Displays VMAC addresses when mode is enabled

**Kernel Parameter:**
- `fwha_vmac_global_param_enabled` controls VMAC mode
- Value 1 = enabled, Value 0 = disabled
- Applies globally to all cluster interfaces

## Integration Patterns

**Network Topology Compatibility:**
- Multi-switch environments
- VLAN-based segmentation
- ISP redundancy configurations
- Load sharing implementations
