# Context-Aware Knowledge Surfacing

## Core Concept

Context-aware knowledge surfacing intelligently presents relevant notes and connections based on current projects, temporal context, and user activity patterns, moving beyond simple search toward proactive knowledge discovery that anticipates information needs.

## Research Context

Addresses the PKM challenge of information overload and the difficulty of remembering what you know. This concept transforms PKM from a reactive storage system into a proactive thinking partner.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Ultimate PKM Strategy Synthesis 2025 (Learning-Optimized Retrieval section)
- **Credibility Score**: 8
- **Validation Method**: Synthesized from retrieval research and adaptive systems design principles

## Connection Potential

Links to machine learning, recommendation systems, semantic search, temporal analysis, user modeling, and intelligent assistants research.

## Implementation Notes

- Track user activity patterns and project contexts
- Use semantic similarity to identify relevant dormant content
- Surface historical insights related to current work
- Provide temporal context for knowledge evolution
- Balance proactive suggestions with user agency

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Extracted from PKM synthesis research on retrieval optimization
- **Future**: Develop specific algorithms for context detection and relevance scoring
