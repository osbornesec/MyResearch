## Core Concept

A systematic workflow for processing knowledge from raw sources through quality review to final integration, using staged validation checkpoints to ensure atomic compliance, source attribution, and network integration quality.

## Research Context

This workflow methodology was developed and validated through the Smart Extraction implementation process, demonstrating how systematic staging with quality gates prevents errors and ensures knowledge integration standards.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Smart Extraction Implementation Reports documenting workflow effectiveness
- **Credibility Score**: 9
- **Validation Method**: Successfully applied across multiple domains with quality metrics tracking

## Connection Potential

- Links to [[strategic-extraction-criteria-framework]] for content selection
- Connects to [[hybrid-knowledge-architecture-pattern]] for integration approach
- Relates to [[smart-extraction-rate-optimization]] for efficiency optimization
- Enhances ingest directory processing and automation frameworks

## Implementation Notes

**Workflow Stages:**
1. **Raw Sources**: Unprocessed materials with initial placement
2. **Batch Processing**: Organized sets for systematic analysis
3. **Quality Review**: Content validation and standards compliance
4. **Integration**: Final vault placement with network connections

**Quality Gates:**
- **Source Attribution**: All content maintains provenance tracking
- **Atomic Compliance**: Single-concept note structure validation
- **State Management**: Clear progression from fleeting to permanent
- **Link Integration**: Bidirectional connections established
- **MOC Placement**: Content integrated into organizational structures
- **Archive Records**: Processing history maintained for audit

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Multi-source verification for critical claims
- Cross-reference validation against existing knowledge
- Connection quality assessment for semantic value
- Network health monitoring for discoverability

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Extracted from systematic workflow validation across domains
- **Future**: Develop automation tools to support quality gate processing
