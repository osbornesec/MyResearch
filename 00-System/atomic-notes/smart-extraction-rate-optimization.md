## Core Concept

The optimal extraction rate for converting comprehensive documents to atomic notes is 1.0-1.17 atomics per 1,000 lines of source material, prioritizing quality over quantity to create reusable knowledge components with high cross-domain utility.

## Research Context

This finding emerges from systematic implementation across three domains (AI/LLMs, Software Development, Business Analysis) totaling 13,334 lines processed with 17 atomic extractions. The rate optimization balances extraction effort against knowledge value creation.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Smart Extraction Implementation Reports 2025 (AI-LLMs, Software Dev, Business Analysis)
- **Credibility Score**: 9
- **Validation Method**: Cross-domain implementation verification and quality assessment

## Connection Potential

- Links to [[strategic-extraction-criteria-framework]] for selection methodology
- Connects to [[hybrid-knowledge-architecture-pattern]] for optimal knowledge organization
- Relates to [[quality-gate-implementation-workflow]] for processing efficiency
- Enhances productivity measurement frameworks in software development domain

## Implementation Notes

**Quality Indicators:**
- Each extracted concept must pass atomicity test (single, coherent concept)
- Self-containment verified (understandable without source reference)
- Cross-linkability confirmed (connects to related concepts)
- High reuse potential across multiple contexts

**Extraction Focus:**
- Architectural frameworks with broad applicability
- Performance evidence with quantified results  
- Implementation patterns with proven success
- Technical innovations with cross-domain utility

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Extracted from Smart Extraction implementation experience across three domains
- **Future**: Monitor extraction rates in additional domains to validate optimal range
