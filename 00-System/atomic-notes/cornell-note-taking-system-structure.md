# Cornell Note-Taking System Structure

## Core Concept

The Cornell system divides note-taking into three distinct sections that support both initial capture and subsequent review. This structured approach transforms passive recording into active learning through built-in question generation and summarization.

## Three-Section Layout

### Notes Section (Right Side)
**Purpose**: Capture main content during learning or reading
**Content**: Detailed explanations, key facts, examples, diagrams
**Approach**: Focus on comprehensive recording without interrupting flow

### Cues/Questions Section (Left Side)  
**Purpose**: Generate keywords and questions for active recall
**Content**: Key terms, review questions, concept prompts
**Timing**: Created after initial capture during review phase

### Summary Section (Bottom)
**Purpose**: Synthesize key takeaways and connections
**Content**: Brief synthesis of main insights and relationships
**Value**: Standalone reference for rapid comprehension

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Create** note using Cornell template structure
2. **Capture** main content in Notes section during learning
3. **Generate** cues and questions in left margin afterward  
4. **Summarize** key insights in bottom section
5. **Review** using cues for active recall practice
6. **Connect** to related knowledge through linking

## Active Learning Benefits

### Built-in Review System
Cues section provides immediate prompts for self-testing and active recall, eliminating need for separate review preparation.

### Question-Driven Engagement  
Left margin questions encourage deeper thinking about content relationships and applications during review.

### Synthesis Practice
Summary section requires distillation and connection-making, reinforcing understanding through active processing.

## Digital Enhancements

### Obsidian Adaptations
- **Callouts**: Use for visual separation of sections
- **Links**: Connect to related notes and concepts
- **Multimedia**: Include images, audio, and video content
- **Templates**: Standardize structure for consistent application

### Advanced Features
- **Flashcards**: Convert cues into spaced repetition cards
- **Queries**: Search across Cornell notes by section type
- **Automation**: Generate questions using AI assistance
- **Review Scheduling**: Integrate with spaced repetition systems

## Success Requirements

- **Structure Discipline**: Consistent use of three-section format
- **Question Quality**: Cues that genuinely test understanding  
- **Summary Clarity**: Concise synthesis capturing core value
- **Regular Review**: Active engagement with cues for recall practice
