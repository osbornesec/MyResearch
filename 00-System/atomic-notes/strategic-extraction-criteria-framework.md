## Core Concept

A systematic decision framework for knowledge extraction that prioritizes concepts based on cross-domain utility, reusability, architectural significance, performance evidence, and proven implementation success rather than attempting comprehensive extraction.

## Research Context

This framework emerged from analysis of successful extractions across AI/LLMs, Software Development, and Business Analysis domains, identifying patterns that distinguish high-value atomic concepts from comprehensive source material.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Smart Extraction Implementation Reports with extraction pattern analysis
- **Credibility Score**: 9
- **Validation Method**: Validated through successful implementation across three domains with quality metrics

## Connection Potential

- Links to [[smart-extraction-rate-optimization]] for efficiency optimization
- Connects to [[hybrid-knowledge-architecture-pattern]] for architectural integration
- Relates to [[quality-gate-implementation-workflow]] for processing standards
- Enhances decision-making frameworks across all domains

## Implementation Notes

**High-Value Extraction Targets:**
1. **Architectural Frameworks**: Abstract patterns with broad applicability
2. **Performance Evidence**: Quantified results and benchmarks
3. **Implementation Patterns**: Proven methodologies with demonstrated success
4. **Technical Innovations**: Cross-domain utility and emerging importance

**Selection Criteria:**
- **Cross-Domain Utility**: Concept applies beyond single domain context
- **Reusability**: Can be referenced without accessing source material
- **Strategic Significance**: Foundational concept for decision-making
- **Evidence-Based**: Supported by quantified data or proven results
- **Synthesis Potential**: Enables combination with other concepts

**Avoid Extracting:**
- Tool-specific instructions that may become obsolete
- Content better understood in comprehensive context
- Highly domain-specific details without broader application
- Procedural steps that require sequential reading

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Extracted from multi-domain extraction pattern analysis
- **Future**: Refine criteria based on ongoing extraction experience and usage patterns
