# Spaced Repetition for Knowledge Management

## Core Concept

Spaced repetition optimizes the forgetting curve by scheduling reviews at increasing intervals just before natural forgetting occurs. This evidence-based approach transforms passive information storage into active memory consolidation for PKM systems.

## Forgetting Curve Optimization

### Review Interval Schedule
- **Initial Review**: 1 day after first encounter
- **Second Review**: 3 days after initial review  
- **Third Review**: 7 days after second review
- **Subsequent Reviews**: Expanding intervals based on recall success

### Adaptive Scheduling Principles
- **Success Adaptation**: Increase intervals for easily recalled concepts
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Decrease intervals for challenging material
- **Context Variation**: Test knowledge in different contexts for robust understanding
- **Interleaving**: Mix different content types in review sessions

## Active Recall Integration

### Question Generation Methods
- **Factual Recall**: "What are the core components of..."
- **Conceptual Understanding**: "Why does X work better than Y..."  
- **Synthesis Application**: "How would you combine X and Y to..."

### Implementation Techniques
- **Self-Testing**: Regular knowledge testing rather than re-reading
- **Elaborative Interrogation**: Deep "why" and "how" questions
- **Generation Effect**: Create content rather than just consume
- **Retrieval Practice**: Access information from memory without cues

## PKM Integration Strategies

### Content Processing
1. **Create** review questions during note creation
2. **Schedule** new concepts for spaced repetition
3. **Convert** insights into testable knowledge
4. **Track** recall success for interval optimization

### Knowledge Network Enhancement
- **Connection Testing**: Verify relationships between linked concepts
- **Cross-Domain Application**: Test knowledge transfer across domains
- **Synthesis Validation**: Confirm understanding of combined concepts
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring themes through repetition

## Success Metrics

### Learning Effectiveness
- **Recall Success Rate**: Target 85-90% for optimal challenge
- **Retention Duration**: Increasing intervals between successful recalls
- **Application Ability**: Successful knowledge use in new contexts
- **Transfer Rate**: Knowledge application across different domains

### System Health
- **Review Consistency**: Regular completion of scheduled reviews
- **Question Quality**: Reliable testing of actual understanding
- **Coverage Completeness**: All important concepts included
- **Evolution Rate**: System adaptation to changing knowledge needs
