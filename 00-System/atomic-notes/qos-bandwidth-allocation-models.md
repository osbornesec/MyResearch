# QoS Bandwidth Allocation Models

## Core Concept

Systematic bandwidth allocation methodologies within Check Point QoS framework providing guaranteed, proportional, and priority-based traffic management for enterprise network optimization and SLA enforcement.

## Allocation Model Types

### Guaranteed Bandwidth
- **Minimum Allocation**: Guaranteed minimum bandwidth allocation per traffic class
- **Reserve Pool**: Bandwidth reserved exclusively for specific traffic types
- **SLA Enforcement**: Service level agreement compliance through guaranteed rates
- **Critical Applications**: Ensures essential business applications receive required bandwidth

### Proportional Sharing
- **Percentage-Based**: Bandwidth allocation based on percentage of total available
- **Dynamic Sharing**: Unused bandwidth automatically redistributed to active flows
- **Fair Queuing**: Proportional bandwidth sharing across multiple traffic classes
- **Adaptive Allocation**: Allocation adjusts based on real-time traffic patterns

### Priority-Based Allocation
- **Strict Priority**: High-priority traffic receives preference over lower priority
- **Weighted Priority**: Priority levels with configurable weights and limits
- **Queue Management**: Multiple priority queues with overflow handling
- **Preemption Support**: Higher priority traffic can preempt lower priority flows

## Implementation Strategies

### Hierarchical QoS
- **Class Hierarchies**: Multi-level traffic classification with nested bandwidth allocation
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Bandwidth inheritance and limit enforcement
- **Aggregate Control**: Top-level bandwidth control with sub-allocation
- **Flexible Deployment**: Supports complex enterprise network topologies

### Traffic Shaping Algorithms
- **Token Bucket**: Token bucket algorithm for rate limiting and burst control
- **Leaky Bucket**: Smoothing algorithm for consistent traffic rate enforcement
- **Weighted Fair Queuing**: Fair bandwidth distribution across multiple flows
- **Class-Based Queuing**: Service class-based queuing and scheduling

## Enterprise Deployment Patterns

### WAN Link Management
- **Link Utilization**: Optimal utilization of expensive WAN bandwidth
- **Application Priority**: Business-critical applications receive bandwidth priority
- **Backup Link Support**: QoS policies for primary and backup link scenarios
- **Provider Integration**: Coordination with service provider QoS frameworks

### Branch Office Scenarios
- **Central Allocation**: Centralized bandwidth policy management for branches
- **Local Adaptation**: Branch-specific adjustments to global QoS policies
- **Application Awareness**: Branch-specific application priority and allocation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Centralized monitoring of branch office QoS performance

## Frame Relay Specific Allocations

### CIR Management
- **Committed Information Rate**: Guaranteed bandwidth allocation within Frame Relay
- **Burst Allowance**: Handling of traffic bursts beyond CIR limits
- **BE Traffic**: Best-effort traffic management beyond committed rates
- **Provider Coordination**: Integration with Frame Relay provider QoS parameters

### Sample Allocation Patterns
- **Mission Critical**: 40% allocation for business-critical applications
- **Standard Business**: 30% allocation for normal business applications
- **Best Effort**: 20% allocation for non-critical traffic
- **Reserve Pool**: 10% reserve for emergency or high-priority bursts

## Performance Optimization

### Bandwidth Calculation
- **Overhead Accounting**: Calculations include protocol and encryption overhead
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Real bandwidth utilization accounting for all overhead
- **Compression Benefits**: Bandwidth calculations with compression algorithms
- **Protocol Efficiency**: Per-protocol bandwidth efficiency considerations

### Real-Time Adaptation
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Real-time bandwidth allocation based on current demand
- **Load Balancing**: Automatic load balancing across available bandwidth
- **Congestion Management**: Automatic response to network congestion conditions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring and optimization of allocations

## Integration Capabilities

### VPN Traffic Management
- **Tunnel Bandwidth**: QoS allocation for VPN tunnel traffic
- **Encryption Overhead**: Bandwidth calculations including encryption overhead
- **Site-to-Site QoS**: QoS enforcement across VPN site-to-site connections
- **Remote Access**: QoS for remote access VPN users

### Application-Aware Allocation
- **Application Recognition**: Automatic application identification and classification
- **Dynamic Policies**: Application-specific bandwidth allocation policies
- **Business Rules**: Bandwidth allocation based on business application priorities
- **Custom Applications**: Support for custom application QoS requirements
