# Threat Prevention SandBlast Architecture

## Core Concept

Advanced threat prevention architecture combining Threat Emulation, Threat Extraction, and Zero Phishing technologies to provide comprehensive protection against unknown malware, targeted attacks, and phishing through cloud and on-premises analysis capabilities.

## SandBlast Component Architecture

### Threat Emulation
- **Sandbox Technology**: Advanced sandbox environment for unknown file analysis
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Dynamic analysis of file behavior in controlled environment
- **Cloud Integration**: ThreatCloud emulation for scalable analysis capabilities
- **Local Emulation**: On-premises emulation for sensitive or air-gapped environments

### Threat Extraction
- **Content Disarming**: Removes potentially malicious content while preserving functionality
- **File Reconstruction**: Reconstructs clean files from potentially malicious originals
- **Zero-Delay Protection**: Immediate file delivery with threat removal
- **Format Preservation**: Maintains original file format and usability

### Zero Phishing
- **URL Analysis**: Real-time analysis of suspicious URLs and links
- **Phishing Detection**: Advanced phishing attack detection and prevention
- **Brand Protection**: Protection against brand impersonation attacks
- **User Education**: Real-time user education about phishing attempts

## Emulation Deployment Architectures

### Inline Deployments
- **Real-Time Protection**: Files analyzed in real-time during network transit
- **Traffic Inspection**: Deep packet inspection with emulation integration
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient inline processing with minimal latency
- **Policy Enforcement**: Immediate policy enforcement based on emulation results

### Monitor Deployments (SPAN/TAP)
- **Passive Monitoring**: Non-intrusive monitoring of network traffic
- **Forensic Analysis**: Detailed forensic analysis of network communications
- **Compliance Reporting**: Comprehensive compliance and audit reporting
- **Network Visibility**: Complete network visibility without performance impact

### Mail Transfer Agent Integration
- **Email Security**: Specialized email threat prevention and analysis
- **Attachment Analysis**: Comprehensive email attachment emulation
- **Link Protection**: URL analysis and protection for email links
- **Policy Integration**: Email-specific threat prevention policies

## Analysis Location Options

### Cloud Emulation (ThreatCloud)
- **Scalable Analysis**: Unlimited analysis capacity through Check Point cloud
- **Global Intelligence**: Access to global threat intelligence and signatures
- **Rapid Updates**: Real-time updates to threat detection capabilities
- **Cost Efficiency**: No on-premises emulation infrastructure required

### Local Emulation
- **Data Sovereignty**: Analysis performed within organization boundaries
- **Air-Gapped Support**: Support for disconnected and secure environments
- **Custom Policies**: Organization-specific emulation policies and configurations

- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Automatic fallback between cloud and local analysis
- **Optimization Strategies**: Optimal analysis location selection for performance

## Handling Mode Configurations

### Emulation with Threat Extraction Disabled
- **Block Mode**: Files blocked until emulation analysis completes
- **Background Mode**: Files allowed while analysis continues in background
- **Risk-Based Decisions**: Handling mode based on file risk assessment
- **Performance Considerations**: Balance between security and user experience

### Emulation with Threat Extraction Enabled
- **Extract and Emulate**: Files extracted for immediate delivery and emulated for analysis
- **Parallel Processing**: Simultaneous extraction and emulation for optimal performance
