# Serendipity Engine Design Patterns

## Core Concept

Serendipity engines use algorithmic approaches to facilitate unexpected connections and creative insights in PKM systems through random note surfacing, similarity clustering, temporal pattern tracking, and cross-domain integration to engineer beneficial "accidents" in knowledge discovery.

## Research Context

Based on creativity research showing that breakthrough insights often emerge from connecting previously unrelated domains. This concept operationalizes serendipitous discovery through systematic design patterns rather than leaving it to chance.
