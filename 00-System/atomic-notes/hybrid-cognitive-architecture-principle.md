# Hybrid Cognitive Architecture Principle

## Core Concept

Human cognition is optimized for pattern recognition and synthesis, not storage and retrieval. PKM systems must complement, not replace, natural cognitive strengths by using external systems for storage while leveraging human cognition for connection-making and insight generation.

## Research Context

This principle addresses the fundamental design question in PKM: how to optimally distribute cognitive work between human minds and technological systems. It represents a shift from seeing PKM tools as mere storage toward viewing them as cognitive extension systems.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Ultimate PKM Strategy Synthesis 2025 (Section: Core Principles)
- **Credibility Score**: 8
- **Validation Method**: Synthesized from historical PKM analysis and cognitive science research

## Connection Potential

Links to cognitive load management, external cognition theory, distributed cognition frameworks, human-computer interaction design, and PKM tool selection criteria.

## Implementation Notes

- Design interfaces that minimize cognitive load during storage and retrieval
- Optimize for human pattern recognition and synthesis capabilities
- Automate routine cognitive tasks (filing, searching, basic organization)
- Preserve human agency in connection-making and insight generation

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-16**: Created from PKM strategy synthesis research
- **Future**: Connect to cognitive science literature on distributed cognition and external memory systems
