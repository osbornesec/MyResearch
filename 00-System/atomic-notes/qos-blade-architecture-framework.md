# QoS Blade Architecture Framework

## Core Concept

Integrated Quality of Service blade within Check Point security gateway providing traffic classification, bandwidth management, and service level enforcement through dedicated QoS engine and policy framework.

## QoS Architectural Components

### QoS Engine
- **Function**: Core traffic classification and bandwidth enforcement engine
- **Integration**: Embedded within Check Point security gateway kernel
- **Performance**: Hardware-accelerated traffic shaping and queuing
- **Scalability**: Designed for enterprise bandwidth management requirements

### QoS Daemon (fgd50)
- **Purpose**: QoS policy management and configuration distribution daemon
- **Responsibilities**: Policy compilation, rule distribution, and real-time adjustments
- **Communication**: Interfaces with SmartConsole for policy management
- **Monitoring**: Provides QoS statistics and performance metrics

### SmartConsole Integration
- **Policy Management**: Integrated QoS policy creation and management interface
- **Rule Configuration**: Graphical interface for traffic classification and bandwidth rules
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time QoS performance and utilization monitoring
- **Reporting**: QoS statistics and compliance reporting capabilities

## Traffic Classification Framework

### Classification Criteria
- **Service-Based**: Traffic classification by network service type
- **Source-Based**: Classification by traffic source IP addresses and networks
- **Application-Based**: Application-aware traffic identification and classification
- **Combined Criteria**: Multi-dimensional classification using multiple parameters

### Bandwidth Management
- **Allocation Models**: Various bandwidth allocation and sharing models
- **Priority Queuing**: Traffic prioritization based on business requirements
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-rule and per-interface bandwidth limiting capabilities
