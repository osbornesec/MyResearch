# Progressive Summarization Technique

## Core Concept

Progressive summarization creates layered understanding by gradually distilling content from complete capture to essential insights. This iterative refinement process preserves context while highlighting core value, enabling both detailed reference and rapid comprehension.

## Four-Layer Distillation Process

### Layer 1: Complete Capture
Preserve original content without modification, maintaining full context and detail. This foundation ensures comprehensive reference material remains accessible.

### Layer 2: Passage Highlighting  
Identify and highlight key sentences and important insights using bold formatting. Focus on content that directly supports understanding or application.

### Layer 3: Enhanced Emphasis
Apply additional highlighting to the most crucial information within already-highlighted passages. This creates a hierarchy of importance within selected content.

### Layer 4: Executive Summary
Create brief synthesis capturing essential insights and core principles. Executive summaries distill complex content into immediately actionable understanding.

## Implementation Guidelines

### First Pass Criteria
- Capture complete content with minimal processing
- Preserve original structure and context
- Focus on comprehensive collection over analysis

### Second Pass Criteria  
- Highlight 10-20% of original content
- Select passages supporting main themes
- Prioritize actionable insights and key evidence

### Third Pass Criteria
- Emphasize 10-20% of highlighted content  
- Focus on transformative insights and core principles
- Identify content requiring immediate attention

### Fourth Pass Criteria
- Synthesize into 1-3 key insights
- Generate actionable next steps
- Create standalone summary valuable without original

## Key Benefits

- **Layered Accessibility**: Multiple levels serve different reading needs
- **Context Preservation**: Original content remains intact and searchable
- **Insight Emergence**: Progressive focus reveals core value
- **Retrieval Efficiency**: Multiple access points optimize for different uses

## Quality Standards

- **Selectivity**: Each layer should contain significantly less than the previous
- **Independence**: Higher layers should be valuable without lower layers
- **Accuracy**: Summaries must faithfully represent original insights
- **Actionability**: Final layers should enable immediate application
