# Performance Investigation Baseline Establishment

## Core Concept

Effective performance troubleshooting requires establishing clear environmental baselines before investigating issues. This systematic approach begins with understanding expected behavior through hardware sizing, traffic blend analysis, and configuration assessment to create accurate performance expectations.

## Research Context

Performance issues cannot be accurately diagnosed without baseline understanding. This methodology addresses the common problem of reactive troubleshooting by requiring proactive environment characterization that enables precise problem identification and resolution.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Check Point SK167553 - Performance Investigation Procedure
- **Credibility Score**: 9
- **Validation Method**: Official Check Point support documentation with current versioning

## Connection Potential

Builds on performance-optimization-methodologies and connects to capacity-planning-framework. Relates to system-baseline-monitoring for continuous performance management.

## Baseline Establishment Framework

**Environment Sizing Requirements:**
- **Hardware Specifications**: Platform identification (e.g., 5000, 16000 series)
- **Security Blade Configuration**: NGTP, IPS, HTTPS inspection enablement
- **Traffic Blend Analysis**: DNS, IPsec, HTTPS, IPv4/IPv6 distribution
- **Software Configuration**: Version, kernel, firewall mode assessment
- **Architecture Topology**: CoreXL instances, cluster configuration

**Expected Throughput Determination:**
- **Appliance Sizing Tool**: Official sizing calculations based on configuration
- **Blend-Specific Metrics**: Performance varies significantly by traffic type
- **Version Impact**: Feature and performance characteristics by release
- **IPv4/IPv6 Considerations**: Separate baseline requirements for dual-stack

**Critical Baseline Metrics:**
- **Connection Rate**: New connections per second capability
- **Throughput Capacity**: Mbps/Gbps under specific blade configurations
- **Latency Expectations**: Normal processing delays by traffic type
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and acceleration usage norms

## Implementation Notes

**Pre-Investigation Requirements:**
1. Document complete environment configuration
2. Establish expected performance using sizing tools
3. Identify traffic change patterns or recent modifications
4. Validate baseline metrics against vendor specifications

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Hardware platform matches documented specifications
- Security blade configuration accurately assessed
- Traffic blend representative of normal operations
- Recent changes documented and impact assessed

## Evolution Notes

- **2025-06-17**: Extracted from Check Point performance investigation methodology
- **Future**: Integrate with automated baseline monitoring and drift detection
