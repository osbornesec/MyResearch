# Entropy-Based LLM Sampling (Entropix System)

## Core Concept

Context-aware sampling system that uses entropy and varentropy of logits combined with attention-based metrics to dynamically adjust LLM sampling strategies, achieving improved coherence and reduced hallucinations.

## Key Innovations

### 1. Entropy-Varentropy Decision Matrix
Uses combinations of entropy (uncertainty) and varentropy (uncertainty variability) to select optimal sampling strategies:
- **Low E, Low V**: Greedy sampling (high confidence)
- **High E, Low V**: Clarification insertion (consistent uncertainty)
- **Low E, High V**: Exploration sampling (varying confidence)
- **High E, High V**: High uncertainty sampling (maximum uncertainty)

### 2. Attention-Aware Metrics
- **Attention Entropy**: Measures spread of attention across tokens
- **Attention Agreement**: Consistency across different attention heads
- **Interaction Strength**: Magnitude of token relationships

### 3. Dynamic Parameter Adjustment
Real-time adjustment of sampling parameters based on model state:
- **Temperature**: Adjusted by uncertainty and agreement levels
- **Top-k/Top-p**: Modified based on interaction strength and attention patterns
- **Min-p**: Threshold adjusted by uncertainty levels

## Technical Implementation

### Metrics Calculation
```python
entropy, varentropy = calculate_varentropy_logsoftmax(logits)
attn_entropy = -sum(attention_probs * log2(attention_probs))
agreement = mean(abs(attention_probs - mean_attention))
interaction_strength = mean(abs(attention_scores))
```

### Adaptive Sampling Process
1. Generate multiple samples (default: 12)
2. Score samples: log_probability + confidence_score
3. Select highest-scoring sample
4. Apply strategy-specific parameter adjustments

## Performance Impact

- **Improved Coherence**: Maintains consistency over longer generations
- **Reduced Hallucinations**: Dynamic adjustment mitigates high-uncertainty errors
- **Context Sensitivity**: Attention-aware sampling preserves context
- **Flexible Generation**: Seamless strategy transitions based on uncertainty
