# SCALES Framework Systematic Capture Component

## Core Concept

The Systematic Capture component of the SCALES framework optimizes multi-modal input based on dual coding theory, incorporating quick capture, structured intake, automated ingestion, and analog integration to minimize cognitive load during knowledge acquisition.

## Research Context

Part of the comprehensive SCALES PKM framework that addresses the critical challenge of frictionless knowledge capture across diverse input modalities while preserving context and enabling immediate organization.

## Source Quality

- **Primary Source**: Ultimate PKM Strategy Synthesis 2025 (SCALES Framework section)
- **Credibility Score**: 8
- **Validation Method**: Evidence-based synthesis from cognitive science research on dual coding theory

## Connection Potential

Links to dual coding theory, cognitive load management, workflow optimization, template systems, automation frameworks, and multi-modal learning research.

## Implementation Notes

- Voice notes and mobile capture for immediate input
- Email-to-PKM and API integrations for automated ingestion
- Templates for different content types to reduce processing overhead
- Digitization workflows for handwritten notes integration
- Context preservation and source information retention

## Evolution Notes
