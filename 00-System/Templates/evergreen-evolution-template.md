# {{title}}

## Core Concept

*One complete thought unit - conceptually indivisible and contextually independent*

[Describe the single concept this note captures. Focus on clarity and completeness.]

## Content

### What is this concept?
[Define the concept precisely and unambiguously]

### Why is it important?
[Explain significance, implications, and value]

### How does it work/apply?
[Provide mechanism, process, or application details]

### What are the key relationships?
[Connect to other concepts and show interactions]

## Connections

*Link to related atomic notes, sources, and MOCs using semantic relationships*

### Evidential Connections
- [[Supporting Evidence]] #supports this concept
- [[Contradicting Evidence]] #refutes aspects of this concept

### Causal Connections  
- [[Prerequisite Concept]] #enables this concept
- [[Resulting Outcome]] #caused-by this concept

### Hierarchical Connections
