# JWT Token Security Pattern

## Core Concept

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) provide a stateless, secure authentication mechanism for APIs through cryptographically signed tokens that contain encoded user information and expiration timestamps.

## Content

### What is the JWT Security Pattern?

JWT authentication follows a three-part token structure (header.payload.signature) that enables:
- **Stateless authentication**: No server-side session storage required
- **Self-contained tokens**: All necessary user information embedded in token
- **Cryptographic verification**: HMAC SHA256 signature prevents tampering
- **Controlled expiration**: Built-in timestamp limits token validity window

### Why is it Important?

1. **Scalability**: Eliminates need for centralized session storage
2. **Security**: Short-lived tokens minimize exposure risk if compromised
3. **Flexibility**: Can be passed via headers or query parameters
4. **Standard compliance**: Industry-standard approach for API authentication

### Implementation Pattern

**Token Structure:**
```
Header: {"alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT"}
Payload: {"iss": "API_KEY", "exp": 1496091964000}
Signature: HMACSHA256(base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload), secret)
```

**Security Best Practices:**
- Set short expiration windows (seconds to minutes)
- Use strong API secrets for signing
- Implement token refresh mechanisms
- Validate signatures on every request

### How it Connects to Other Concepts

This pattern enables secure API access control and integrates with:
- OAuth 2.0 authorization flows
- REST API authentication layers
- Microservices security architectures
- Rate limiting and request validation
