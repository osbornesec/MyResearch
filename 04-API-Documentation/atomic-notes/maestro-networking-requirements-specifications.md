# Maestro Networking Requirements Specifications

## Core Concept
CheckPoint Maestro requires dedicated physical interfaces for synchronization with specific port assignments: Internal sync (Port 48), External sync (Port 47/56), and strict latency requirements (≤1ms) for dual-site deployments.

## Synchronization Network Architecture
- **Internal Sync (Port 48)**: DAC/fiber connections between orchestrators within same site
- **External Sync (Port 47/56)**: Cross-site synchronization with direct fiber or Layer 2 switches
- **Dedicated Interfaces**: Synchronization traffic requires separate physical interfaces from production
- **Latency Constraint**: External sync links must maintain ≤1ms latency for proper operation

## Traffic Distribution Requirements
- **ECMP Hashing**: 5-tuple parameters for inbound packet distribution across gateways
- **Gateway-Specific NAT**: Outbound traffic uses source NAT to preserve path symmetry
- **Minimum Bandwidth**: 10 Gbps downlink interfaces (1 Gbps via SFP converters only)
- **Bonding Mandatory**: 802.3ad recommended for management and uplink ports

## Dual-Site Architecture Requirements
- **Identical Orchestrator Models**: Both sites must use matching hardware
- **Symmetrical Distribution**: Minimum 1 gateway per site per Security Group
- **Direct Connectivity**: DAC/fiber connections between sites' external sync ports
- **VLAN Support**: Required on uplink ports and bonds for network integration
