# API Pagination Strategy

## Core Concept

API pagination strategies manage large dataset retrieval through controlled result segmentation, enabling efficient data transfer, improved performance, and better user experience by breaking large collections into manageable chunks.

## Content

### What is API Pagination?

API pagination divides large result sets into smaller, manageable pages through:
- **Page Size Control**: `page_size` parameter to specify results per request
- **Cursor-Based Navigation**: `next_page_token` for stateless pagination
- **Metadata Inclusion**: Total counts and navigation information
- **Consistent Interface**: Uniform pagination across all list endpoints

### Why is it Important?

1. **Performance Optimization**: Reduces memory usage and response times
2. **Network Efficiency**: Smaller payloads mean faster data transfer
3. **User Experience**: Progressive loading enables responsive interfaces
4. **System Stability**: Prevents resource exhaustion from large queries
5. **Mobile Compatibility**: Reduced bandwidth usage for mobile applications

### Implementation Patterns

**Zoom API Pagination Model:**
- **Token-Based**: Uses `next_page_token` instead of offset-based pagination
- **Page Size Control**: Client can specify `page_size` parameter
- **Stateless Design**: Each token contains all necessary state information
- **Consistent Format**: Same pagination pattern across all list endpoints

**Request Pattern:**
```
GET /v2/users?page_size=30&next_page_token=xyz123
```

**Response Pattern:**
```json
{
    "page_count": 1,
    "page_size": 30,
    "total_records": 25,
    "next_page_token": "abc456",
    "users": [...]
}
```

### Pagination Strategy Benefits

**Token-Based Advantages over Offset:**
- **Consistency**: Results remain stable even with data changes
- **Performance**: More efficient for large datasets
- **Stateless**: No server-side session storage required
- **Scalability**: Works well with distributed systems

**Client Implementation Considerations:**
- **Page Size Optimization**: Balance between performance and usability
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache pages for better user experience
- **Progress Indication**: Show loading states and total progress
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of token expiration

### How it Connects to Other Concepts

Pagination strategies work with:
- REST API design principles for resource collection patterns
- Rate limiting for request management
- Caching strategies for performance optimization
- Mobile API design for bandwidth efficiency
