# API Rate Limiting Strategy

## Core Concept

API rate limiting implements traffic control mechanisms to prevent system overload, ensure fair resource allocation, and maintain service reliability through request throttling based on time windows and endpoint sensitivity.

## Content

### What is API Rate Limiting?

Rate limiting controls the frequency of API requests through:
- **Time-based quotas**: Maximum requests per time window (e.g., 10 requests/second)
- **Endpoint differentiation**: Different limits for various API endpoints
- **Usage tiers**: Varying limits based on user type or subscription level
- **Burst handling**: Temporary allowances for brief traffic spikes

### Why is it Important?

1. **System Stability**: Prevents resource exhaustion and service degradation
2. **Fair Access**: Ensures equitable resource distribution among users
3. **Cost Control**: Manages computational and infrastructure costs
4. **Security**: Mitigates abuse and potential DoS attacks
5. **SLA Compliance**: Maintains service level agreements and performance

### Implementation Patterns

**Zoom API Rate Limiting Model:**
- **Standard Endpoints**: 10 requests/second baseline
- **Billing APIs**: 1 request/second (resource-intensive operations)
- **Report/Metrics APIs**: 1 request/second + 2000 requests/day limit
- **Heavy Analytics**: 1 request/minute for detailed metrics

**Response Handling:**
- **HTTP 429 Status**: "Too Many Requests" error response
- **Rate Limit Headers**: Current usage and reset time information
- **Retry Strategies**: Exponential backoff and queue management

### Strategic Considerations

**Rate Limit Design Factors:**
- **Endpoint Complexity**: Higher limits for lightweight operations
- **Resource Impact**: Lower limits for database/computation-heavy endpoints
- **User Experience**: Balance between protection and usability
- **Business Logic**: Align limits with subscription tiers and use cases

### How it Connects to Other Concepts

Rate limiting integrates with:
- Authentication systems for user identification
- Error handling patterns for graceful degradation
- System monitoring for usage analytics
- API design patterns for optimal resource allocation
