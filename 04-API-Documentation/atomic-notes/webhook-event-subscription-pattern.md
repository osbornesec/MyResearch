# Webhook Event Subscription Pattern

## Core Concept

Webhook event subscriptions enable real-time, event-driven communication between systems through HTTP callbacks that deliver notifications when specific events occur, reducing the need for continuous polling and enabling responsive integrations.

## Content

### What is the Webhook Event Subscription Pattern?

Webhooks implement a publisher-subscriber pattern where:
- **Event Publishers**: Source systems (like Zoom) that generate events
- **Event Subscriptions**: Configuration defining which events to monitor
- **HTTP Callbacks**: POST requests sent to subscriber endpoints when events occur
- **Event Verification**: Security mechanisms to authenticate webhook payloads
- **Response Requirements**: Acknowledgment patterns for successful delivery

### Why is it Important?

1. **Real-Time Responsiveness**: Immediate notification of system changes
2. **Efficiency**: Eliminates need for continuous polling and reduces API calls
3. **System Decoupling**: Loosely coupled integration between independent systems
4. **Scalability**: Event-driven architecture scales better than request-response patterns
5. **User Experience**: Enables instant updates and responsive applications

### Implementation Patterns

**Webhook Configuration Requirements:**
- **HTTPS Endpoint**: Secure callback URL that accepts POST requests
- **JSON Payload Handling**: Ability to parse event data structures
- **Response Timing**: Must respond with 200/204 status within 3 seconds
- **Event Verification**: Validate webhook authenticity using signatures
- **Error Handling**: Implement retry logic for failed webhook deliveries

**Event Subscription Setup:**
1. **Configure Endpoint**: Set up HTTPS URL in application settings
2. **Select Events**: Choose specific event types to monitor
3. **Implement Handler**: Create endpoint to process webhook payloads
4. **Add Verification**: Validate incoming webhook signatures
5. **Handle Responses**: Return appropriate HTTP status codes

**Common Event Types:**
- **User Events**: Account creation, profile updates, status changes
- **Meeting Events**: Meeting start/end, participant join/leave, recording completion
- **System Events**: Configuration changes, billing updates, compliance events

### Integration Architecture

**Webhook Processing Flow:**
1. **Event Trigger**: Action occurs in source system
2. **Event Publishing**: System generates webhook payload
3. **HTTP Delivery**: POST request sent to configured endpoint
4. **Payload Processing**: Receiving system parses and processes event data
5. **Acknowledgment**: Response status confirms successful receipt

### How it Connects to Other Concepts

Webhook patterns integrate with:
- OAuth authentication for secure event subscriptions
- API design principles for consistent payload structures
- Error handling patterns for delivery failure management
- System monitoring for webhook health and performance
