## Content Organization Principles

1. **Thematic Organization**: Content grouped by domain expertise rather than tools or sources
2. **Progressive Hierarchy**: General to specific organization (max 4 directory levels)
3. **Consistent Naming**: kebab-case file and directory names for clarity
4. **Single Source of Truth**: Each piece of content exists in exactly one location
5. **Clear Documentation**: Each major section includes purpose and scope

## Usage

This repository serves as a structured knowledge base supporting:
- AI research and prompt engineering development
- Software development methodology reference
- Business analysis and market research
- Template and document generation

Navigate by domain area using the numbered top-level directories. Each section includes detailed documentation and cross-references where applicable.
